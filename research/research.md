# RisingWave: A Cloud-Native Streaming Database Deep Dive

## Overview

**RisingWave** is an open-source **distributed SQL streaming database** designed for real-time data processing ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=What%20is%20RisingWave%3F)). It provides a **unified platform** for ingesting event streams, performing **incremental stream processing**, and serving low-latency queries on the results ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=RisingWave%20simplifies%20end,applications%E2%80%94going%20beyond%20traditional%20stream%20processors)) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Iceberg%29%20or%20any%20destination)). In essence, RisingWave combines the roles of traditional stream processors (like Apache Flink or Spark Streaming) and analytical databases into one system. This unified approach addresses the complexity of modern data pipelines by **eliminating the need to bolt together separate messaging, processing, and storage systems** ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=How%20does%20RisingWave%20simplify%20your,driven%20architecture)). Developers can ingest millions of events per second, join streams with historical tables, and query up-to-the-second results using standard SQL in the **PostgreSQL dialect** ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Streaming%20Data%20Lakehouses)) ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20wire,barrier%20to%20mastering%20stream%20processing)).

RisingWave’s primary goal is to **simplify real-time data infrastructure streaming analytics more accessible ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=focus%20is%20on%20delivering%20strong,all%20other%20streaming%20systems%20do)). Unlike traditional databases, which operate on stored, bounded data, a streaming database like RisingWave continuously processes unbounded event streams and updates query results incrementally. And unlike typing frameworks, which often require complex code and external storage, RisingWave offers a familiar relational database experience – **it is wire-compatible with PostgreSQL**, so users can interact with it using ordinary SQL clients and tools ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=PostgreSQL%20compatibility)) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Stream%20processors)). This lowers the barrier to entry for stream processing; **developers can leverage existing SQL skills and tools** (JDBC, `psql`, BI dashboards, etc.) instead of writing Java/Scala code or managing state manually ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20wire,enabling)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=With%20PostgreSQL%20compatibility%2C%20RisingWave%20allows,a%20new%20system%20from%20scratch)).

**What problem does RisingWave solve?** It targets the **latency gap** between transaction processing and analytics. Traditional databases (OLTP or OLAP) cannot natively handle high-velocity streaming inputs or provide live incremental results, and traditional streaming systems were “**too complicated**” for many companies to use effectively ([Streaming data processing platform RisingWave lands $36M to launch a cloud service | TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/streaming-data-processing-platform-risingwave-lands-36m-to-launch-a-cloud-service/#:~:text=Wu%20founded%20RisingWave%20in%20early,to%20most%20companies%20to%20use)). RisingWave’s **streaming-first design** enables sub-second data freshness, supporting use cases like **real-time dashboards, monitoring/alerting, fraud detection, and streaming ETL** ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20particularly%20effective%20for,the%20following%20use%20cases)). By **blending stream ingestion and query serving in one system**, it removes the need to maintain separate message queues, stream processors, and external databases in an event-driven architecture ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=How%20does%20RisingWave%20simplify%20your,driven%20architecture)). In short, RisingWave **continuously ingests and processes live data and immediately makes query results available** via SQL – something that would otherwise require a completecture or custom integration of Kafka, Flink, and a database.

**How is it different from exis?** Compared to conventional databases, RisingWave is **optimized for streaming workloads**: it does incremental computation under the hood, rather than periodic batch recomputati ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Analytical%20databases)). It maintains results as *materialized views* that update on the fly. Meanwhile, unlike stream processing frameworks that lack storage, RisingWave has a built-in **storage engine and query layer** to serve results directly ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Stream%20processors%20excel%20at%20fast%2C,in%20storage%20and%20querying%20capabilities)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Both%20RisingWave%20and%20Apache%20Flink,time%20stream%20processing%20applications)). It offers **automatic state management, fault tolerance, and scaling**, relieving users from dealing with checkpoints or RocksDB tuning as they would in Flink ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Stream%20processors%20like%20ksqlDB%2C%20Spark,It%20excels%20in)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=RisingWave%20comes%20with%20automated%20state,state%20management%20and%20fault%20tolerance)). RisingWave’s cloud-native architecture (detailed below) also focuses on **cost efficiency** – the team claims up to *10× lower cost* than traditional designs by decoupling compute from storage and scaling resources on demand ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Cloud)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=RisingWave)). Overall, RisingWave can be seen as **a next-generation streaming database** that unifies streaming and relational paradigms, bringing **real-time analytics** into the mainstream with approachable SQL interfaces.

## Architecture & Design

 ([Architecture | RisingWave](https://legacy-docs.risingwave-labs.com/docs/1.4/architecture/)) *High-level architecture of mplified). A **Meta node** (right) manages cluster mordination. **Compute nodes** (top row, red) handle SQL query execution and stream processing, ingesting from **sources** and delivering results to **sinks** or applications. **Compactor nodes** (bottom row, orange) manage persistent storage of tables and materialized states in cloud storage, performing compaction and retrieval. This disaggregated design allows independent scaling of storage.*

At its core, RisingWave follows a **cloud-native, disaggregated architecture** built for elastic scaling ([

- **Meta Node (Meta Service)** – a coordinator service that holds cluster metadata and oversees the whole system. The meta node tracks **streaming job gralth,** and so forth ([

- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=The%20meta%20server%20is%20responsible,including%20but%20not%20limited%20to>)). It is responsible for orchestration tasks like **injecting synchronization barriers** (for checkpoints), assigning tasks to compute nodes, and detecting failures via heartbeats ([

- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=The%20meta%20server%20is%20responsible,including%20but%20not%20limited%20to>)). The meta node is essentially the “brain” of the cluster ensuring all parts work in concert.

- **Compute Layer (Compute Nodes)** – the **stateless query executors** that do the heavy lifting of stream processing and query computation ([
RisingWave - Revision #24
- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=,layer%20and%20the%20processing%20layer>)). Compute nodes ingest data from external **sources** (e.g. Kafka topics, database change logs, etc.), apply the SQL-defined transformations (filters, joins, aggregations, etc.), anlts. They handle both **streaming queries** (continuous materialized views) and any ad-hoc queries. Because compute nodes do not store persrmanently (only in-memory buffers), they can be scaled out or in dynamically. When a query plan is submitted, the **frontend/serving layerpute nodes or separately) parses and optimizes the SQL, then **distributes the execution plan** to multiple compute nodes for parallel execution ([
RisingWave - Revision #24
- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=,layer%20and%20the%20processing%20layer>)). This forms a distributed dataflow, partitioned via consistent hashing for parallelism ([
RisingWave - Revision #24
- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=>)). The compute layer processes data in a **vectorized execution model** for efficiency – using “data chunks” and “stream chunks” with columnar batches and per-row visibility flags for inserts/deletes ([

RisingWave - Revision #24
- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=,layer%20and%20the%20processing%20layer>)). All persistent data in RisingWave – whether base tables, materialized views, or intermediate state of streaming operators – is ultimately stored in an **external object storage service (cloud storage)** by the compactor layer ([

This layer enables RisingWave’s **decoupled storage**: compute nodes don’t keep long-term state, but read/write data through the compactor, which persists it to durable storage (e.g. Amazon S3, HDFS, etc.) ([
RisingWave - Revision #24
- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=RisingWave%20has%20a%20disk,HDFS%2FWebHDFS%20as%20shared%20storage%20destinations>)) ([Data persistence - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/reference/data-persistence#:~:text=%2A%20S3%2C%20or%20S3,support%20implemented%20via%20Apache%20OpenDAL)). This design crucially allows **independent scaling of storage and compute** – for example, one can add more compute nodes to boost throughput without replicating the entire dataset in state is centralized in the object store ([
RisingWave - Revision #24
- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=Shared>)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=RisingWave)). It also means **fast recovepute node fails, a new one can retrieve the state from storage via a compactor node and resume processing within seconds ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=high%20performance.%20,rather%20than%20minutes%20or%20hours)) ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=If%20a%20failure%20occurs%2C%20only,should%20not%20exceed%201%20seconds)).

- **Serving Layer (Frontend)** – logically, RisingWave includes a **SQL serving layer** (often part of the compute nodes) that accepts client connections over the PostgreSQL protocol ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=PostgreSQL%20compatibility)). This layer parses and plans SQL queries, and coordinates with the meta service to either execute one-time read queries or deploy persistent materialized views. It essentially provides the database interface to users and **translates SQL into streaming dataflow pipelines**.

These components together implement RisingWave’s **“uni stream”** processing engine ([Architecture - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/reference/architecture#:~:text=RisingWave%20comprises%20several%20key%20components%3A,unified%20batch%20and%20streaming)). Streams and tables are treaed way under the hood. Notably, RisingWave’s designers built the system **top-down for SQL workloads** (in contrast to some systems that build a general dataflow engine first) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=design%20built%20for%20the%20cloud%3A,so%20you%27d%20better%20confirm%20with)). This means the execution engine is specialized for relational operators and leverages database techniques like **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)** and optimized joins. The storage engine uses an **N-ary row-based model** (storing rows as key-value pairs) rather than columnar format ([
RisingWave - Revision #24

- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=N>)), since streaming workloads often apply point lookups and incremental updates. All data is stored in **block-based SSTables (sorted string tables)**, with each table file containing sorted key-value pairs plus metadata like Bloom filters for efficient reads ([
RisingWave - Revision #24
- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=Log>)). The LSM tree and MVCC approach allow RisingWave to **retain multiple versions of data** – which is how features like **Time Travel (historical querying)** are implemented (described later). New data is written in immutable files and older versions eventually compacted away, optimizing for high ingest rates and fast reads.

Another key design principle is **“stream-table duality”**, meaning that streams and tables are two sides of the same coin. In RisingWave, an incoming stream can be ingested into a *table* (an **append-only table** or a **materialized source**), and a streaming query produces output that can be continually materialized as a table. Developers define **materialized views (MVs)** in SQL on top of streams or tables, and the system maintains those views incrementally as new events arrive ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=How%20are%20materialized%20views%20used,within%20RisingWave)) ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=,both%20tables%20and%20materialized%20views)). Under the hood, each MV is represented as **state** in the storage layer plus a pipeline of computations in the compute layer. This design eliminates the impedance mismatch between streaming data and relational queries – any streaming computation result can be queried as if it were a standard table. RisingWave’s use of **back-pressure aware streaming** and **watermarks** (for event-time windowing) ensures the pipelines remain consiste ([RisingWave: Best-in-Class Real-Time Stream Processing & Analytics Platform - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/overview/#:~:text=Rich%20Set%20of%20ConnectorsImage%3A%20%E2%86%93)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=serving%20real,and%20reducing%20complexity%20and%20cost)).

**Compute/Storage Separation:** By persisting all state in remote storage (e.g. S3) and keeping compute stateless, RisingWave achieves cloud elasticity and resource efficiency. The system can **scale in or out within seconds** by adding/removing compute nodes on the fly ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=,rather%20than%20minutes%20or%20hours)) – something that would be hard if state was tied to each node. Likewise, on a cloud infrastructure, storage can grow independently (and cheaply on S3) while compute resources can be right-sized to The RisingWave team explicitly calls out that it was “created during the cloud era” and leverages modern decoupled architecture to maximize elasticity and cost-efficiency ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=RisingWave)). This is a contrast to older frameworks like Flink which keep state on local disks (e.g. RocksDB) and thus must scale **“monolithically”** (every node carries both compute and a chunk of state) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Image)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=As%20a%20computing%20framework%20born,achieve%20high%20parallelism%20and%20scalability)). In ding more compute doesn’t force data redistribution of stored state – new compute nodes simply pull the needed state partitions from object storage via the compactor layer.

**Multi-Stage Processing and MVs:** RisingWave encourages composing complex logic through multiple **cascaded materialized views** (one view reading from another) to form multi-stage pipelines ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=match%20at%20L387%20,both%20tables%20and%20materialized%20views)). Thanks to the SQL interface, this is as simple as defining successive `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ... AS SELECT ...` statements. The system will manage the dependency DAG and ensure each intermediate is kept up-to-date. This composability is a differentiator especially over systems like ksqlDB (which cannot easily join results of one query into another) ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=Lack%20of%20Composability)). The **meta node** keeps track of this streaming DAG (often called a **stream graph**) and coordinates **barrier synchronization** across all operators for consistent snapshotting ([

- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=The%20meta%20server%20is%20responsible,including%20but%20not%20limited%20to>)). Barriers (checkpoints) flow through the compute dataflow, and when the compactor nodes persist a snapshot, the meta node knows it represents a globally consistent cut of the stream ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=RisingWave%20adopts%20the%20Chandy%E2%80%93Lamport%20algorithm,and%20highly%20available%20remote%20storage)) ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=RisingWave%20adopts%20the%20Chandy%E2%80%93Lamport%20algorithm,and%20highly%20available%20remote%20storage)).

**Consistency Model:** RisingWave provides **atomic, consistent updates** to its materialized views via a combination of MVCC storage and checkpointing. While it is not an ACID transaction processing system (it doesn’t support multi-statement transactions on streaming data ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20PostgreSQL%20wire,events%20rather%20than%20transactional%20data))), it ensures **exactly-once processing** semantics for streams. All source offsets and operator states are included in periodic checkpoints (using the **Chandy-Lamport algorithm** for distributed snapshot) and written to durable storage ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=RisingWave%20adopts%20the%20Chandy%E2%80%93Lamport%20algorithm,and%20highly%20available%20remote%20storage)) ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=If%20a%20failure%20occurs%2C%20only,should%20not%20exceed%201%20seconds)). If a failure occurs, the cluster can restore to the last checkpoint state, ensuring no duplicates or data loss for replayable sources ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=If%20a%20failure%20occurs%2C%20only,should%20not%20exceed%201%20seconds)) ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=from%20one%20day%20earlier%2C%20but,from%20the%20checkpoint%20at%201%3A00%3A24)). Reads (queries) always see a consistent snapshot as of the latest checkpoint, which avoids partial updates ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=RisingWave%20adopts%20the%20Chandy%E2%80%93Lamport%20algorithm,and%20highly%20available%20remote%20storage)) ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=For%20read%20queries%2C%20data%20is,data%20is%20correct%20and%20consistent)). In practice, the checkpoint interval is very short (configurable, default **1 second** ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=fetch%20the%20states%20from%20the,should%20not%20exceed%201%20seconds))), so **failover recovery is near-instant** (on the order of a second or two for worst-case lost data) ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=If%20a%20failure%20occurs%2C%20only,should%20not%20exceed%201%20seconds)) ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=fetch%20the%20states%20from%20the,should%20not%20exceed%201%20seconds)). This ign point: RisingWave is built to **recover from failures in seconds rather than minutes** ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=high%20performance.%20,rather%20than%20minutes%20or%20hours)), minimizing disruption in continuous workloads.

To summarize the design: RisingWave’s architecture embodies a **“streaming database engine”** with decoupled, cloud-friendly components. It marries **stream processing techniques (dataflow, incremental state)** with **database techniques (SQL optimization, MVCC storage)** to achieve a balance of **performance, fault-tolerance, and usability**. By **persisting state to cloud storage** and using an elastic cache (memory+disk) on compute nodes for hot data ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Elastic%20disk%20cache)) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Beyond%20caching%20hot%20data%20in,and%20cutting%20S3%20access%20costs)), it achieves both **durability and low-latency**. This architecture greatly simplifies the overall data stack needed for real-time analytics – many users can replace a tangle of Kafka + Spark/Flink + Cassandra with just RisingWave and their data sources/sinks ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=How%20does%20RisingWave%20simplify%20your,driven%20architecture)).

## Key Capabilities

**SQL Interface and PostgreSQL Compatibility:** RisingWave presents **standard SQL** as its interface for both defining streaming computations and querying data ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=effectively%20process%20streaming%20data%3B%20,Materialize%20are%20written%20in%20Rust)) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=PostgreSQL%20compatibility)). Its SQL dialect is PostgreSQL-like, meaning it supports common Postgres data types, functions, and syntax, making it immediately familiar to users. Importantly, it speaks the **PostgreSQL wire protocol**, Postgres (e.g. `psql`, JDBC/ODBC, BI tools) can connect to RisingWave as if it were a Postgres database ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20wire,enabling)). This compatibility includes supporting **structured, semi-structured (JSON)**, and even unstructured data types within SQL ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=PostgreSQL%20compatibility)). Users can perform **ad-hoc queries** using SQL, and also define **continuous queries** in SQL which become *materialized views*. The system hides the complexity of stream processing behind the SQL interface – there is **no need to write low-level code or manage state manually** ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Stream%20processors%20like%20ksqlDB%2C%20Spark,It%20excels%20in)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=RisingWave%20comes%20with%20automated%20state,state%20management%20and%20fault%20tolerance)). For instance, a user can simply write a SQL join between a live stream and a static table; RisingWave will continuously maintain the join result under the hood.

**Materialized Views and Real-Time Transformation:**in RisingWave are modeled as **materialized views (MVs)**. A materialized view is defined by a SQL `CREATE MATEW ... AS SELECT ...` over one or more source streams/tables. Once defined, RisingWave will **incrementally update the view as new data arrives**, so that the view’s contents are always fresh and queryable ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=How%20are%20materialized%20views%20used,within%20RisingWave)) ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=,both%20tables%20and%20materialized%20views)).

- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=query%20mode%20and%20the%20streaming,support%20for%20time%20window%20functions>)). It is particularly optimized for **streaming joins over large state** (for example, joining a big historical ta ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=yingjunwu%20%20%20%2062))ent stream) by using indexes and state that can spill to disk or S3 as needed ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=)).

Materialized views in RisingWave are **strongly consistent** – each update is applied in an all-or-nothing fashion across tis consistency even across complex pipelines is a key feature. For example, you can **cascade views** (one view reading froand RisingWave will ensure each derived view sees a consistent snapshot of its upstream inputs ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=,both%20tables%20and%20materialized%20views)). The use of **barriers and checkpoints** means that ichanges at time *T*, all downstream views will reflect either the state before *T* or after *T*, but never a mixture ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=RisingWave%20adopts%20the%20Chandy%E2%80%93Lamport%20algorithm,and%20highly%20available%20remote%20storage)) ([Fault tolerance - RisingWave](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/fault-tolerance/#:~:text=For%20read%20queries%2C%20data%20is,data%20is%20correct%20and%20consistent)). This is crucial for **deterministic results** in streaming analytics.

**Stateful Stream Processing (Windows, Aggregations, Joins):** RisingWave provides a rich set of streaming primitives out-of-the-box. It supports **time-based aggregations and windowing** natively in SQL, using standard syntax. For example, you can use g windows)**and **CUMULATE** window functions in queries to do windowed grouping ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=q14%20in%20the%20comparison%20table,is%20the%20reason%20for%20each)). It also handles **event time and watermarks** – you can define sources as **event-time streams** and specify how watermarks are generated (e.g.,  ([CREATE TABLE - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/sql/commands/sql-create-table#:~:text=CREATE%20TABLE%20,the%20progress%20of%20event)). Watermarks allow RisingWave to know when it has seen “en to finalize a window result, similar to Flink’s mechanism ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20a%20window%20aggregation,by%20removing%20the%20watermark%20definition)).

Currently, RisingWave supports tumbling, hopping, and cumulative windows; support for session windows (with gaps) has been noted as lower priority but on the roadmap ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=,Since%20our)).

For **stream joins**, RisingWave can do both **stream-to-streable (upsert table) joins**. Stream-to-stream joins require handling potentially unbounded state (matching events across time). RisingWave can join streams on keys with optional time conditions (e.g. join where timestamps are within X seconds) – the **“as-of join”** or temporal join scenario. In facteature includes **“Streaming As-Of Joins”** which efficiently find the nearest matching event in one stream for an event in another based on time ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=snapshotting%2C%20manual%20versioning%2C%20or%20audit,4%20min%20read%20Read%20More)) ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=feature%20is%20particularl,different%20sources%20may%20not%20match)). This is critical for use cases like joining a trade event stream withte stream to get the latest quote as of the trade’s time. RisingWave’s support for such temporal joins and window joins enables sophisticated **time-series event matching** in pure SQL. All joins and aggregations are executed in a **fully incremental fashion** – e.g., a join wills new events and update the join results (inserting or retracting matches) as needed, rather than re-scanning entire tables.

**“TimQueries:** A standout capability of RisingWave is its support for **time travel queries**, which let users query historical state of data **as of a past time** ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Time%20Travel)) ([Time Travel Queries: Query Historical Insights from Streaming Data - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/blog/time-travel-queries-in-risingwave-unlocking-historical-insights-from-streaming-data/#:~:text=A%20Time%20Travel%20Query%20allows,clock%E2%80%9D%20and%20inspect%20previous%20records)). This feature is not common in streaming systems. Using the SQL syntax `SELECT * FROM table_name FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF <timestamp>;`, one can retrieve a table or materialized view’s contents at a past point in time ([Time Travel Queries: Query Historical Insights from Streaming Data - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/blog/time-travel-queries-in-risingwave-unlocking-historical-insights-from-streaming-data/#:~:text=and%20inspect%20previous%20records)). Under the hood, this leverages the MVCC storage – RisingWave keeps old versions of data for a configurable retention period (default 10 minutes) ([Time Travel Queries: Query Historical Insights from Streaming Data - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/blog/time-travel-queries-in-risingwave-unlocking-historical-insights-from-streaming-data/#:~:text=Optional%3A%20Step%201%20,the%20Retention%20Period)). For example, if a suspicious event occurred 5 minutes ago, an analyst can “rewind” a materialized view to see exactly what its output was at that time. This is immensely useful for **debugging, auditing, and forensic analysis** on streaming data ([Time Travel Queries: Query Historical Insights from Streaming Data - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/blog/time-travel-queries-in-risingwave-unlocking-historical-insights-from-streaming-data/#:~:text=1,in%20Capital%20Markets)) ([Time Travel Queries: Query Historical Insights from Streaming Data - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/blog/time-travel-queries-in-risingwave-unlocking-historical-insights-from-streaming-data/#:~:text=A%20customer%20claims%20they%20had,withdrawal%2C%20their%20balance%20seems%20incorrect)). Time travel queries essentially treat the stream processing engine like a time-machine, avoiding the need for manual snapshotting or external log analysis ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Travel%20Queries%20in%20RisingWave%3A%20Unlocking,need%20to%20join%20them%20by)) ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=snapshotting%2C%20manual%20versioning%2C%20or%20audit,trading%2C%20risk%20analytics%2C%20and%20IoT)). Real-world scenarios include investigating account balances around a disputed transaction or replaying an order book state at a past timestamp ([Time Travel Queries: Query Historical Insights from Streaming Data - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/blog/time-travel-queries-in-risingwave-unlocking-historical-insights-from-streaming-data/#:~:text=1,in%20Capital%20Markets)) ([Time Travel Queries: Query Historical Insights from Streaming Data - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/blog/time-travel-queries-in-risingwave-unlocking-historical-insights-from-streaming-data/#:~:text=Using%20a%20time%20travel%20query%2C,it%20was%20at%202%3A30%20PM)). To use time travel, one can adjust the `time_travel_retention_ms` parameter to keep history longer (e.g. hourspending on needs ([Time Travel Queries: Query Historical Insights from Streaming Data - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/blog/time-travel-queries-in-risingwave-unlocking-historical-insights-from-streaming-data/#:~:text=Optional%3A%20Step%201%20,the%20Retention%20Period)). The ability to query **“as-of” data with a simple clause** is a major convenience for maintaining **historical consistency** and performing **“what-if” analyses** on recent data in motion.

 for Ingest and Delivery:**RisingWave is built to integra ecosystems via **connectors**. It has a **connector framework** for **sources** (ingestion) and **sinks** (delivery) supporting a variety of systems. Natively supported sources include **message queues and logs** like **Apache Kafka, Redpanda, Pulsar**, cloud streaming services like **Amazon Kinesis**, and database change data capture (CDC) from **MySQL and PostgreSQL** ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Apache%20Kafka%20%2038MySQL%20,40Snowflake%20%2042All%20connectors)) ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=DocsUse%20Cases%20%209RisingWave%20vs,ksqlDB%20%2036)). It also can ingest from data lakes or files (e.g. **Apache Iceberg tables, AWS S3 files**). For example, you can create a source in RisingWave that directly subscribes to  (with JSON or Avro encoding), or a CDC stream of MySQL binlog. On the sink side, Risin ([Streaming Lakehouse - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/lakehouse/#:~:text=both%20live%20and%20historical%20data))ts to various systems**: it can write to Kafka topics, to cloud storage (S3/Google Cloud Storage), to databases like PostgreSQL or Snowflake, or to file systems in formats like Parquet ([Highlights of RisingWave v2.0: The Open-Source Streaming SQL Database | by RisingWave Labs | Real-Time Data Evolution | Medium](https://medium.com/real-time-data-evolution/highlights-of-risingwave-v2-0-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database-f09b18c49de3#:~:text=Compatibility%20with%20Parquet%20files)) ([Highlights of RisingWave v2.0: The Open-Source Streaming SQL Database | by RisingWave Labs | Real-Time Data Evolution | Medium](https://medium.com/real-time-data-evolution/highlights-of-risingwave-v2-0-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database-f09b18c49de3#:~:text=Delivering%20data%20in%20Parquet%20format,PARQUET)). A noteworthy integration is with **Apache Iceberg** – RisingWave can continuously **sink query results into Iceberg** tables in a data lake ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=RisingWave%20Overview%20The%20technical%20tour,your%20existing%20databases%20%208)). This effectively enables **streaming ETL into a lakehouse** (hence their term “Streaming Lakehouse” for using RisingWave + Iceberg together).

Connectors support different input/output formats: **upsert**, **append-only**, or **Debezium** (for CDC) modes ([Overview of data delivery - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/delivery/overview#:~:text=Overview%20of%20data%20delivery%20,please%20refer%20to%20the)). RisingWave’s source connectors have “**built-in intelligence to detect backpressure**” ([RisingWave: Best-in-Class Real-Time Stream Processing & Analytics Platform - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/overview/#:~:text=Rich%20Set%20of%20ConnectorsImage%3A%20%E2%86%93)), meaning they can slow or speed ingestion to match system capacity. In v2.2, RisingWave introduced **“webhook connectors”**, allowing it to ingest data from webhooks (essentially acting as an HTTP endpoint source) – useful for IoT devices or services that push events via HTTP. Also, in v2.2, they added a **“CREATE CONNECTION”** object, which lets you define reusable connection configs (e.g., Kafka broker addresses, credentials) and reference them in multiple source/sink ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v22/#:~:text=Reusable%20connections%20for%20Kafka%20connector,and%20schema%20registries)) ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v22/#:~:text=desired%20parameters)). This reduces duplication and eases managing secure credentials (store once, reuse many).

For **data formats**, RisingWave supports JSON, Avro, Protobuf, etc., and has recently added **Apache Parquet** support for both reading and writing batch data ([Highlights of RisingWave v2.0: The Open-Source Streaming SQL Database | by RisingWave Labs | Real-Time Data Evolution | Medium](https://medium.com/real-time-data-evolution/highlights-of-risingwave-v2-0-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database-f09b18c49de3#:~:text=Compatibility%20with%20Parquet%20files)) ([Highlights of RisingWave v2.0: The Open-Source Streaming SQL Database | by RisingWave Labs | Real-Time Data Evolution | Medium](https://medium.com/real-time-data-evolution/highlights-of-risingwave-v2-0-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database-f09b18c49de3#:~:text=Delivering%20data%20in%20Parquet%20format,PARQUET))or example, ingest a static Parquet dataset from S3 as one input, join it with a real-time Kafka stream, and sink results back as Pa and streaming worlds seamlessly ([Highlights of RisingWave v2.0: The Open-Source Streaming SQL Database | by RisingWave Labs | Real-Time Data Evolution | Medium](https://medium.com/real-time-data-evolution/highlights-of-risingwave-v2-0-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database-f09b18c49de3#:~:text=Delivering%20data%20in%20Parquet%20format,PARQUET)).

**Unified Streaming + Batch Processing:** Although RisingWave is streaming-first, it also handles batch queries and static data. Users can **create normal tables** and **INSERT** data (batch loads) or use connectors to bulk load. RisingWave can execute regular one-time SQL queries (e.alytical query over a materialized view or table) using a **batch mode** of the execution engine. The query optimizer can choose different strategies if it knows a source is bounded (e.g. use sort-merge join for two bounded inputs). In fact, the system has two modes internally: a streaminr MVs) and a batch mode (for ad-hoc queries or static backfill) with some different operator choices ([

- Database of Databases](<https://dbdb.io/db/risingwave/revisions/24#:~:text=query%20mode%20and%20the%20streaming,support%20for%20time%20window%20functions>)). Because of this flexibility, RisingWave can act as both a streaming **pipeline processor** and a **queryable database**. It even provides a **Python SDK** and support for integration with libraries like **pandas or  you can treat RisingWave as an analytical database in a data science workflow ([Highlights of RisingWave v2.0: The Open-Source Streaming SQL Database | by RisingWave Labs | Real-Time Data Evolution | Medium](https://medium.com/real-time-data-evolution/highlights-of-risingwave-v2-0-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database-f09b18c49de3#:~:text=RisingWave%20Python%20SDK)) ([Highlights of RisingWave v2.0: The Open-Source Streaming SQL Database | by RisingWave Labs | Real-Time Data Evolution | Medium](https://medium.com/real-time-data-evolution/highlights-of-risingwave-v2-0-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database-f09b18c49de3#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20using%20sqlalchemy%2C,its%20potential%20in%20your%20projects)).

**UDFs and Extensibility:** RisingWave supports **user-defined functions (UDFs)** to extend its SQL capabilities. It allows UDFs in multiple programming languages – for example, you can register a Python function and apply it to stream data (there’s a separate Uunctions) ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20User)) ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=User)). It also supports embedding UDFs via **WebAssembly (WASM)** for performance isolation and flexibility ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20User)). Thisn’t feasible in pure SQL (like custom parsing or machine learning scoring) can be deployed into RisingWave and executed as part of the stream pipeline. With UDFs, users aren’t limited to built-in SQL functions; they can express mputations (e.g., a sentiment analysis on a text field, or a complex math formula) and have RisingWave execute it on each event. In v2ents were made to Python UDF support, and in upcoming versions more streamlined integration is expected (possibly even support for storing UDFs in the system catalog).

**Time and Order Semantics:** Because dealing with event time is crucial in streaming, RisingWave provides features like **watermarking, windowing,  filters** directly in SQL ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Time%20and%20Order)) ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Process%20event%20streams%20with%20advanced,temporal%20filtering%20without%20compromising%20consistency)). For example, you can use `NOW()` or event-time columns with interval arithmetic to filter events within certain time bounds. The engine ensures **events are processed in timestamp order (per key)** as much as possible, and uses watermarks to manage out-of-order data. It guarantees results that are **temporally consistent** without user intervention – e.g., avoiding emitting incomplete window results when usingrmark configuration ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20a%20window%20aggregation,by%20removing%20the%20watermark%20definition)). These capabilities let users express **time-sensitive logic (like “only alert if no event arrived in the last 5 minutes”)** easily. RisingWave’s documentation highlights that you can **“process event streams with features like watermarking, time windowing, and temporal filtering without compromising consistency.”** ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Time%20and%20Order)).

**Change Data Capture (CDC) and Schema Evolution:** A particularly useful scenario is **ingesting database change logs** (from MySQL, Postgres, etc.) into RisingWave for real-time sync or analytics. RisingWave has native support for CDC sources (e.g. using Debezium or the database’s WAL). Moreover, it can handle **schema evolpstream sources – if the source DB schema changes, RisingWave can automatically adjust the corresponding table schema in the streaming database ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Schema%20Evolution)). In RisingWave v2.1, **automatic es for Postgres CDC** was introduced (as a premium feature) ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v21-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database/#:~:text=Auto%20schema%20change%20for%20Postgres,to%20Know%20about%20RisingWave%20Premium)) ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v21-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database/#:~:text=RisingWave%20now%20supports%20automatic%20schema,update%20to%20reflect%20the%20change)). When enabled, if an upstream Postgres table adds a new column, the change is propagated so that the RisingWave source table  new schema without manual intervention. This **guarantees schema contracts** are maintained between upstream and downstream ([RisingWave: Best-in-Class Real-Time Stream Processing & Analytics Platform - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/overview/#:~:text=Unified%20Data%20Model%20in%20SQLImage%3A,%E2%86%93)). It’s a valuable feature for production pipelines where schemas evolve – reducing downtime or manual work to align schemas. Additionally, RisingWave supports **schemaless ingestion** for JSON streams: you can ingest a Kafka topic with arbitrary JSON payload by using `INCLUDE payload` and the system will automatically flatten all JSON fields into columns ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v21-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database/#:~:text=)) ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v21-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database/#:~:text=By%20including%20the%20,schemaless_ingestion)). This makes it quick to ingest data without defining a rigid schema up front (similar to how some NoSQL or cloud warehouses handle JSON). The user can later prune or transform the schema as needed ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v21-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database/#:~:text=properties,PLAIN%20ENCODE%20JSON)).

**Ad-hoc Queries and “Serving”:** Unlike many streaming engines, RisingWave allows **ad-hoc SQL queries** on both materialized views and the base tables/streams (including the stored historical data). This means you can treat it like a queryable database for on-demand analysis. For example, you might have a materializtrics, but you can still issue a regular `SELECT` to filter or join that view with another table at query time. RisingWave’s internal execution engine will plan and run such read queries using the latest committed state (the last checkpoint). Because RisingWave retains data (not just transient stream windows), it can serve as the **system of record for streaming data**. It even supports **point-in-time queries on tables** (using the MVCC time-travel feature discussed) which is analogous to how OLTP databases let you query past snapshots (though with limited retention here).

**Performance Optimizations:** The system includes a cost-based SQL optimizer and a vectorized execution engine to maximize throughput. It can push down filters to sources, maintain indexing on keys for fast joins, and uses **batching and vectorizatrtize per-row overhead ([

The use of Rust (a low-level language) allows more efficient memory management and CPU use compared to JVM-based engines ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=In%20queries%20q0,of%20Flink%2C%20developed%20in%20Java)). Also, the **elastic disk cache** feature means even if data doesn’t fit in RAM, RisingWave can cache “hot” state on local SSDs/EBS volumes, providing much faster access than always pulling from S3 ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Elastic%20disk%20cache)) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Beyond%20caching%20hot%20data%20in,and%20cutting%20S3%20access%20costs)). This bridges the gap between purely in-memory systems and slower cloud storage. The caching layer plus compaction means that query latency remains low for frequently accessed data, while older cold data is still available when needed (with a slight latency hit on first access) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Beyond%20caching%20hot%20data%20in,and%20cutting%20S3%20access%20costs)).

In summary, RisingWave offers a **broad set of capabilities** that cover the full lifecycle of streaming data: from(connectors)**, **transformation (SQL, MVs, windows, joins)**, **state management (durable storage, MVCC)**, **serving (low-latency queries, time-travel)**, and **delivery (sinks, subscriptions)**. All of this is accessible through standard SQL and a Postgres-compatible interface, making it a **powerful yet user-friendly platform for real-time data**.

## Comparisons

### RisingWave vs. Apache Flink

Apache Flink is a popular distributed stream processing engine, so many naturally compare it with RisingWave. Both are designed for real-time data processing, but they differ fundamentally in **design, user experience, and operational model** ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Both%20RisingWave%20and%20Apache%20Flink,user%20experiences%2C%20and%20cost%20efficiency)).

- **Programming Model & Ease of Use:** Flink provides low-level APIs (DataStream, ProcessFunction, etc.) and a Scala/Java DSL for streamns, which offers great flexibility but csteep learning curve**. Developers often need to manage event time, watermarks, and state tuning explicitly in Flink. Ris ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Cloud))he other hand, presents a **simple SQL interface** – it “**speaks PostgreSQL-style SQL**” so that users can write queries like they would for a normal database ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Image%3A%20PostgreSQL)). This makes RisingWave **much easier to use** for most data engineers ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Apache%20Flink)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Requires%20extensive%20training%20and%20expertise%2C,already%20familiar%20with%20its%20intricacies)). As one comparison notes, **Flink requires extensive training and expertise**, whereas with RisingWave “developers can hit the ground running without needing to learn a new system from scratch” ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=With%20PostgreSQL%20compatibility%2C%20RisingWave%20allows,a%20new%20system%20from%20scratch)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Apache%20Flink))e is no need in RisingWave to manually manage state or implement complex operators – the system automates that. In short, **RisingWave’s SQL-first approach greatly lowers the barrier to entry** compared to Flink’s programmatic approach ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=RisingWave%20comes%20with%20automated%20state,state%20management%20and%20fault%20tolerance)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Requires%20extensive%20training%20and%20expertise%2C,already%20familiar%20with%20its%20intricacies)).

- **State Management:** Flink applications often require careful state management – using managed keyed state, configuring RocksDB or memory state backends, and setting checkpoint intervals. This can be intricate and “bog down development” with configuration ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Flink%20involves%20manual%20and%20intricate,risk%20of%20errors%20and%20inefficiencies)). RisingWave eliminates user-visible state management: **state is managed behind the scenes**, automatically persisted, checkpointed, and scaled. The user simply creates SQL views; RisingWave handles state sharding, checkpointing, recovery, etc., transparently ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=RisingWave%20comes%20with%20automated%20state,state%20management%20and%20fault%20tolerance)). This is a significant simplification of the development process. There’s **no risk of mismanaging state or inconsistent results** because RisingWave ensures exdates to MVs by design.

- **Completeness of SQL & Query Power:** Flink’s SQL support (via Flink SQL) has improved, but historically many have used Flink for custom logic beyond SQL’s reach, or they faced limitations in SQL (complex joins, etc.). RisingWave’s SQL is quite expressive – it supports multi-way joins, subqueries, and advanced functions. The **RisingWave architecture is optimized to handle complex queries** like multi-stream joins and large window aggregations without “getting stuck” or timing out ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=scenes%2C%20ensuring%20seamless%20state%20management,and%20fault%20tolerance)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=inefficiencies)). By contrast, users often find that implementing very complex pipelines in Flink can be challenging (either not expressible in SQL ation to avoid bottlenecks) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Flink%20involves%20manual%20and%20intricate,risk%20of%20errors%20and%20inefficiencies)). RisingWave also supports features like time travel which Flink does not have in SQL.

- **Built-in Storage & Serving:** Perhaps the biggest architectural difference – **Flink is just a processing engine**; it does not serve queries or store data long-term (beyond state for the computation). It needs to output results to an external database if you want to query them on-demand. RisingWave by design is a **stream** – it has an integrated storage layer and can **directly on fresh results** ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Both%20RisingWave%20and%20Apache%20Flink,time%20stream%20processing%20applications)). This means with RisingWave, you **don’t need a separate serving database** for query results; you can run continuous analytics and query them in one place. Flink, in contrast, often relies on **other datastores for serving real-time data**, which adds complexity and potentially latency ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Both%20RisingWave%20and%20Apache%20Flink,time%20stream%20processing%20applications)). As the RisingWave docs put it, Flink specializes in processing but “relies on other datastores…which may not be optimized for that purpose,” whereas RisingWave provides a **unified batch/stream processing architecture with a built-in serving layer** ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Flink%20specializes%20in%20stream%20processing%2C,and%20reducing%20complexity%20and%20cost)). This simplifies event-driven architead of wiring Flink to Cassandra/Elasticsearch/etc. for serving, RisingWave alone can ingest, process, and answer queries ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Both%20RisingWave%20and%20Apache%20Flink,time%20stream%20processing%20applications)).

- **Cloud-Native Architecture & Cost:** Flink’s architecture originates from the pre-cloud, Hadoop era and uses a **coupled compute+state model** (tasks with local state, typically RocksDB) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Image)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=As%20a%20computing%20framework%20born,achieve%20high%20parallelism%20and%20scalability)). It achieves high throughput but when state grows large (e.g. large joins or long windows), **Flink must scale up the cluster and maintain all that state on expensive VM disks** ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=coupled%20compute%20and%20storage%20architecture,achieve%20high%20parallelism%20and%20scalability)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=However%2C%20this%20very%20architecture%20can,other%20stateful%20stream%20processing%20tasks)). RisingWave, built cloud-native, uses decoupled storage on S3 and stateless compute. This yields **better elasticity and potentially much lower cost** for equivalent workloads ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=RisingWave)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=As%20a%20computing%20framework%20born,achieve%20high%20parallelism%20and%20scalability)). For example, if you have a 1TB state for a streaming join over a year of data, Flink would require every node to have a chunk of that state on SSD and keep the cluster running, whereas RisingWave can spill that 1TB to S3 cheaply and only bring into cache what is needed, scaling compute up or down as load changes. The RisingWave team points out that Flink’s need to “ ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Cloud))nough to handle large streaming joins and other stateful tasks” can **drive up execution costs**, whereas RisingWave can handle large state w compute (since S3 will hold the majority) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=As%20a%20computing%20framework%20born,achieve%20high%20parallelism%20and%20scalability)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=However%2C%20this%20very%20architecture%20can,other%20stateful%20stream%20processing%20tasks)). In practice, RisingWave has demonstrated the ability to **recover from failures in seconds vs. minutes** for Flink, and to scale out in seconds (Flink can scale too, but typically stop-the-world or with some delay) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=,rather%20than%20minutes%20or%20hours)) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=high%20performance.%20,rather%20than%20minutes%20or%20hours)).

- **Performance:** On raw processing speeds, both systems are high-performance. However, recent benchmarks (Nexmark streaming SQL benchmark) show RisingWavextremely well. In one comparison, RisingWave outperformed Flink in **22 out of 27 queries**, often by 2× or more, and in some cases by hundreds of times faster ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=As%20shown%20in%20the%20table%2C,in%20the%20chart)) ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=improvements%20of%20at%20least%2050,in%20the%20chart)). For instance, a complex query involving joins and aggregations (q104) ran **660× faster on RisingWave** than on Flink in that test ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=As%20shown%20in%20the%20table%2C,in%20the%20chart)). These dramatic differences came from RisingWave’s top-down optimized operators from not needing to continuously emit updates when not necessary (RisingWave can use **non-EOWC semantics** to avoid re-emitting intermediate results for a window, whereas Flink’s SQL may not) ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20a%20window%20aggregation,by%20removing%20the%20watermark%20definition)). Flink did outperform RisingWave on a couple of queries where Flink’s use of watermarks gave it an edge (e.g., session windowing) ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=How%20to%20explain%20the%20two,is%20significantly%20slower%20than%20Flink)), but RisingWave is closing those feature gaps (adding window support it lacked). While benways evolving, it’s clear RisingWave’s team has focused on **complex query optimization**, so many workloads that cause Flink to struggle can run efficiently on RisingWave. Additionally, **Rust vs Java** can yield performance wins (no JVM GC pauses, more efficient native code), although for *stateless* workloads I/O often dominates such that both are similar ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=In%20queries%20q0,of%20Flink%2C%20developed%20in%20Java)). Flink remains extremely battle-tested and can scale to huge workloads, but **RisingWave’s early results suggest very competitive performance per node** – with the added benefit of easier horizontal scaling due to decoupled storage.

- **Deployment & Operations:** Flink typically runs as a cluster with a JobManager and TaskManagers. Deploying and updating Flink jobs can involve using YARN/Kubernetes operators or running a Flink service per job. RisingWave deploys as a **long-running database service** – once up, you can create new streams and queries via SQL without restarting the cluster. This is more akin to running a database server (which might be simpler to integrate into devops processes). RisingWave provides a dedicated operator for Kubernetes, Helm charts, etc., similar to Flink’s operator. But because it handles fault tolerance internally, you don’t need to manage external checkpoint storage or job restarts – the **service is self-managing**, which could reduce ops overhead. In terms of **monitoring**, both expose metrics (RisingWave has Prometheus endpoints for its componentpgrades**, Flink might require careful draining of jobs, whereas a database model might allow easier in-place upgrades (especially if backward compatibility is maintained on the wire protocol).

In summary, **RisingWave offers a more user-friendly, integrated approach** versus Flink’s lower-level, component approach. Flink is very powerful and mature, with a larger ecosystem (ML libraries, CEP, etc.), but RisingWave aims to provide **“friction-less” stream processing with 10× cost efficiency** and SQL simplicity ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Both%20RisingWave%20and%20Apache%20Flink,user%20experiences%2C%20and%20cost%20efficiency)) ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20Remarkably%20Easier%20to,efficient%20than%20Flink)). Users who “just want streaming SQL” may prefer RisingWave for its approachability and built-in storage. That said, Flink still might be chosen for certain scenarios – e.g. those requiring **custom complex event processing, exactly-once sinks to transactional systems, or ultra-low latency event-by-event processing** (RisingWave tends to micro-batch via its 1s checkpoints). But for many real-time analytics tasks, RisingWave positions itself as **the easier and cheaper solution** compared to Flink.

### RisingWave vs. Materialize

Materialize is another streaming SQL database often compared to RisingWave. Both share some DNA (both are written in Rust, both offer incremental view maintenance and Postgres compatibility) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=effectively%20process%20streaming%20data%3B%20,Materialize%20are%20written%20in%20Rust)) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=,Materialize%20are%20written%20in%20Rust)). However, there are key differences:

- **Architecture (Distributed vs. Single-node):** Materialize’s open-source version (as of the timeframe of comparison) is essentially **single-node and in-memory** ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=Differences)) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=%2A%20Architecture%3A%20The%20open,team%20designed%20the%20computation%20abstraction)). It uses an in-memory dataflow engine (Timely/Dataflow with Differential) to maintain views, and durability was a later addition (Materialize has added some persistence options, but it started in-memory). In contrast, **RisingWave is distributed by design** – it has a separate front-end and can scale out multiple compute and compactor nodes. It leverages cloud storage (S3, etc.) for persistence from day one ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=Differences)) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=design%20built%20for%20the%20cloud%3A,so%20you%27d%20better%20confirm%20with)). This means Risndle larger data volumes and throughput by scaling horizontally, whereas Materialize (open source) is constrained by a single instance’s resources. (Materialize has a closed-source cloud ebut with a different licensing model.) For a user looking for a **fully open-source distributed streaming DB**, RisingWave is a clear choice since Materialize’s full cluster version is not Apache-licensed (Materialize uses the BSL – Business Source License – which is more restrictive) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=,0)). So **license and open governance** differ: RisingWave is Apache 2.0, Materialize’s core is BSL (source-available but not permissively open for production use until some time elapses) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=,0)).

- **Storage & Persistence:** Materialize historically kept all data in memory (with logical logging for recovery) which meant extremely low latency but potentially high memory cost and risk of running out of space for large state. It has since introduced rock-solid persistence (using an approach called **“persist” with indexed data on disk) in experimental form**, but the architecture is still heavily memory-optimized. R caches as needed, meaning it’s **persistent and can spill to s ([RisingWave vs Apache Flink - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-apache-flink/#:~:text=Flink%20specializes%20in%20stream%20processing%2C,and%20reducing%20complexity%20and%20cost)) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=However%2C%20RisingWave%20does%20not%20feature,might%20be%20a%20better%20fit)). This makes RisingWave more suitable for use cases that involve**very large streaming state (many GBs durability guarantees. Materialize’s in-memory design targets ultra-low latency on smallWave trades a bit of latency to handle much larger scroblem fits in one beefy node and you need sub-millisecond latenciebut for multi-terabyte, multi-node **streaming anal ([Streaming Lakehouse - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/lakehouse/#:~:text=both%20live%20and%20historical%20data))singWave was built with that in mind ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=Differences)).

- **Approach to SQL Engine:** Materialize is built on top of the Timely/Differential dataflow research, meaning it was a **bottom-up design** – a powerful dataflow engine with SQL layered on it ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=design%20built%20for%20the%20cloud%3A,so%20you%27d%20better%20confirm%20with)) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=,optimized%20for%20the%20SQL%20operators)). RisingWave took a **top-down approach** – starting with designing the SQL planner/optimizer and operators specifically for SQL needs ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=design%20built%20for%20the%20cloud%3A,so%20you%27d%20better%20confirm%20with)) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=,optimized%20for%20the%20SQL%20operators)). In practice, both strive for incremental computation of SQL views. Materialize emphasizes strong consistency (its slogan was “**consistency without compromising performance**”), ensuring that even multi-input views are always maintained in a correct state thanks to differential dataflow. RisingWave equally cares about consistency but has focused on **making stream processing accessible and affordable** (“democratize stream processing”) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=,0)). One could say Materialize was very academically driven (coming out of years of research on dataflow), whereas RisingWave is more industry pragmatism (borrowing proven techniques from databases and stream processors). This might affect what each optimizes: Materialize might handle certain incremental diffs extremely efficiently (due to differential’s partial order logic), while RisingWave might have a more traditional RDBMS-like optimizer for complex SQL.

- **Feature Focus:** Both systems support PostgreSQL syntax, but Materialize has implemented some features that RisingWave may not yet have, and vice versa. For instance, Materialize early on supported **temporal joins and fancy event-time semantics** (like joining based on “as of” timelines and doing consistency tracking across inputs). RisingWave has caught up on many of these (with its “as-of join” and watermarks). Materialize supports **Kafka upsert/consistency formats and Debezium** well, which RisingWave also does similarly. RisingWave introduced things like **time travel querying** which Materialize does not have (Materialize can snapshot by sticking to a timestamp in the output of a view but doesn’t expose a simple SQL clause for historical state). Materialize had more mature support for **sinks to Kafka and some integration with Debezium** earlier; RisingWave now also supports Kafka sinks, file sinks, etc. One noteworthy difference: **Materialize does not allow user inserts/updates** – it’s not a general OLTP, whereas RisingWave *does* allow `INSERT/UPDATE` on tables (treating them as upsert streams). However, RisingWave currently lacks multi-statement transactions and certain OLTP features too ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20PostgreSQL%20wire,events%20rather%20than%20transactional%20data)), so both are not full transactional databases.

- **Resource Efficiency:** Being single-node, Materialize requires a **strong server with ample memory** to run heavy workloads. RisingWave can distribute load, potentially leading to better **cost efficiency in the cloud** by using multiple smaller machines or scaling storage independently. RisingWave’s decoupled compute/storage likely gives it an edge in cloud cost optimization – you can use cheap S3 for storing lots of data and just scale compute when processing load is high. Materialize Cloud likely addresses some of this with multi-node, but again at the cost of proprietary licensing.

- **Maturity & Community:** Materialize (the company) launched earlier (around 2019) and has gained adoption especially in the PostgreSQL community. RisingWave (the project) started in 2021 and is newer to the scene, but it quickly open-sourced and has community growth (7K+ GitHub stars, etc.). Materialize being tied to a single company with BSL might limit outside contributors, whereas RisingWave under Apache 2.0 might attract more open-source contribution. **Governance**: RisingWave Labs leads RisingWave, and Materialize Inc. leads Materialize – neither are foundation projects.

The **bottom line**: **RisingWave is a distributed, cloud-native streaming database with persistence; Materialize’s open offering is an in-memory streaming database for single-node usage ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=How%20does%20RisingWave%20compare%20to,Materialize)) ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20a%20distributed%20and,memory%20streaming%20database)).** Materialize excels at low-latency incremental maintenance on a smaller scale, while RisingWave emphasizes scalability and simplicity on cloud infrastructure. For example, if you need to run streaming SQL on a single server for very high update rates with millisecond latencies, Materialize might fit. But if you need to scale out or want an entirely open-source stack on Kubernetes with S3, RisingWave is more fitting. It’s also worth noting the **license difference (Apache vs BSL)** which might matter for some users when choosing between them ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=,0)).

Yingjun Wu (RisingWave’s founder) diplomatically summarized: both are strong teams and share the vision of modernizing stream processing; Materialize focuses on “**consistency + performance**” while RisingWave focuses on “**simplicity + accessibility**” in streaming databases ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=opposite%20way%20%28top,all%20other%20streaming%20systems%20do)) ([Comparison between risingwave and materialize · risingwavelabs · Discussion #1736 · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/risingwavelabs/discussions/1736#:~:text=focus%20is%20on%20delivering%20strong,0)). Technically, both ensure strong consistency of results (exactly-once updates). Materialize’s approach (differential dataflow) is theoretically very efficient for arbitrary calculations, but in practice RisingWave has demonstrated equal or better performance on standard benchmarks, likely due to its SQL-specific optimizations and distributed execution. Also, RisingWave’s use of object storage might introduce slightly higher read latencies than Materialize’s purely in-memory state for some queries, but it gains in durability and cost.

In choosing between them, consider: **deployment model (single-node vs distributed)**, **data volume (in-memory vs storage-backed)**, **license**, and specific feature needs. Both aim to replace lambda architectures with a single system. By 2025, RisingWave has closed many gaps (adding features like multi-source joins, schema evolution, etc.) and stands as a strong alternative to Materialize, especially in cloud environments.

### RisingWave vs. ksqlDB / Kafka Streams

ksqlDB is the streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka (built on Kafka Streams library). It allows defining continuous transformations on Kafka topics using SQL-like syntax. **Kafka Streams** itself is a low-level library (Java API) for building streaming applications, whereas ksqlDB provides a SQL layer on top. Comparing RisingWave to ksqlDB/Kafka Streams highlights some key differences:

- **Standalone Database vs. Kafka-dependent Engine:** RisingWave is a **self-contained streaming database** that can work with many sources (not just Kafka). ksqlDB is essentially an extension of a Kafka cluster – it **runs on Kafka and only processes Kafka topics as input/output**. This means **ksqlDB is limited to the Kafka ecosystem** ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=RisingWave%20support%20composable%20multi,for%20very%20basic%20use%20cases)) ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=Connectivity%20and%20Integration)). If your data isn’t in Kafka, ksqlDB first requires funneling it through Kafka. RisingWave can natively ingest from diverse systems (Kafka, Pulsar, databases, files, etc.) and output to many targets ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=RisingWave%20support%20composable%20multi,for%20very%20basic%20use%20cases)) ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=Connectivity%20and%20Integration)). It is not tied to Kafka’s infrastructure. So RisingWave has **broader connectivity and integration** (e.g., you can join a Kafka stream with a MySQL CDC stream directly in RisingWave, or sink to Iceberg; ksqlDB cannot do that easily). ksqlDB’s tight coupling with Kafka can simplify some things if you are “all-in” on Kafka, but it’s a limitation if you have a heterogeneous stack. As one comparison puts it: *“RisingWave provides built-in diverse data connectors. In contrast, ksqlDB is limited to Apache Kafka integration.”* ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=RisingWave%20support%20composable%20multi,for%20very%20basic%20use%20cases)) ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=Connectivity%20and%20Integration)).

- **Features and SQL Power:** ksqlDB’s SQL dialect is limited compared to RisingWave’s PostgreSQL dialect. ksqlDB supports filters, simple aggregations, windowed aggregations, and stream-table joins, but it **lacks many SQL features** (no support for subqueries, limited join types, no user-defined functions, etc.). RisingWave offers a **full SQL experience** – for example, it supports joins between multiple tables and streams, nested queries, set operations, user-defined functions, etc. **Composability** is a big differentiator: *“RisingWave supports composable multi-stage data pipelines which ksqlDB lacks. Essentially, ksqlDB can only be used for very basic use cases.”* ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=Lack%20of%20Composability)) ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=RisingWave%20support%20composable%20multi,for%20very%20basic%20use%20cases)). In ksqlDB, each query creates a new stream, but you can’t easily join an intermediate result with another in a complex graph; you often end up writing multiple queries manually feeding topics. RisingWave, by contrast, lets you define multiple views and they can feed each other arbitrarily, enabling much **richer processing pipelines** without external topics. Also, ksqlDB lacks some SQL functions (for instance, it doesn’t support all types of joins or windowing that a typical SQL engine might). RisingWave is aiming to be **feature-complete SQL** (e.g., it supports advanced joins, window functions, time travel, etc., which ksqlDB does not).

- **Performance and Scalability:** ksqlDB runs on Kafka Streams, which means it leverages Kafka’s scaling – it will spawn processing tasks that consume from Kafka partitions. It can scale horizontally by increasing the number of ksqlDB servers and partitioning topics. However, ksqlDB is known to struggle with very complex queries or large state (each ksqlDB server keeps local RocksDB state per partition). **RisingWave’s decoupled storage and compute may handle large state and complex queries more gracefully** (as discussed earlier). Also, ksqlDB’s reliance on Kafka for state management (changelogs, repartitions) means its performance is tied to Kafka’s I/O and network overhead. RisingWave’s architecture might achieve higher throughput for multi-way joins or large windows since it can use S3/remote storage and its own compaction rather than funneling everything through Kafka topics. In terms of **latency**, both are near real-time; ksqlDB processes events as they come with low latency, RisingWave might micro-batch by default (~1s barrier) but still is real-time enough for analytics. If Kafka is already at its limits, adding ksql processing can tax it further. RisingWave offloads state to cloud storage which might reduce load on the message bus.

- **Use Cases and Limitations:** ksqlDB is good for quick transformations of Kafka topics (filtering, enriching, simple aggregations) and routing data (like an easier way to set up Kafka Streams pipelines). But it’s **not designed as a general query engine** – you can’t connect BI tools to ksqlDB easily to run ad-hoc queries on the data; typically you would sink the result to a database for that. RisingWave, however, can serve as that analytic database itself. It can **store and serve query results directly**, and users can run ad-hoc queries on streaming results. This makes RisingWave suitable for powering real-time dashboards or user-facing queries, which ksqlDB alone isn’t meant for. Also, ksqlDB doesn’t support **“historical replay or time travel”** beyond Kafka’s retention (you could replay a topic from earlier offset, but there’s no query “as of time” feature). RisingWave provides such features (time travel, etc.) making it more flexible for analytical scenarios. On the flip side, Kafka Streams (and ksqlDB) can incorporate user-defined code through Kafka Streams API if needed, whereas RisingWave’s extension is via UDFs – but RisingWave supports that too with Python/Java/WASM UDFs.

- **Deployment & Management:** ksqlDB essentially runs inside the Kafka ecosystem. Operating ksqlDB means you need a running Kafka cluster, and you run ksqlDB servers as part of that environment. It might be simpler if you already have Kafka – it’s just an add-on. RisingWave is a separate service to deploy (with its own meta node, compute nodes, etc.). So if an organization strictly does everything in Kafka, they may lean on ksqlDB to avoid introducing another system. However, many organizations prefer not to overuse Kafka for storage due to cost (Kafka storage can be expensive for long-term state vs. object storage). RisingWave storing state in S3 might be more cost-effective than ksqlDB storing state in Kafka (which it does indirectly via changelog topics). There’s also **exactly-once semantics**: ksqlDB relies on Kafka transactions for exactly-once, which works within Kafka’s realm. RisingWave ensures exactly-once via its own checkpointing. Both approaches are reliable, but if you need to interface with external sinks, those have to support exactly-once too (RisingWave sinks to Iceberg or databases can manage that with idempotent writes or upsert mode; ksqlDB is mostly writing to Kafka itself or to connectors that may be at-least-once).

- **Enterprise capabilities:** ksqlDB is more of an **embedded stream processor** than a full DBMS, so it lacks features like advanced security, fine-grained auth, or multi-tenancy. RisingWave, being a DB, might introduce roles, permissions, etc. (for instance, RisingWave Cloud likely has multi-tenant project support). For a professional environment, having a SQL database might fit better with governance policies than running ephemeral ksql queries on Kafka.

In summary, **RisingWave is a superset in functionality compared to ksqlDB** – it can do what ksqlDB does (ingest from Kafka, simple transformations) and much more (multi-source joins, complex analytics, serving queries, connectors beyond Kafka). The **advantage of ksqlDB** is if you only use Kafka and want a lightweight, Kafka-native SQL tool with minimal additional components. However, its “**limited streaming and analytical capabilities**” mean it can handle only basic cases and often falls short for enterprise needs ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20a%20full,cannot%20handle%20demanding%20enterprise%20workloads)) ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20a%20full,cannot%20handle%20demanding%20enterprise%20workloads)). As one source bluntly states: *“KsqlDB’s architecture cannot handle demanding enterprise workloads”* ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20a%20full,cannot%20handle%20demanding%20enterprise%20workloads)) ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20a%20full,cannot%20handle%20demanding%20enterprise%20workloads)). RisingWave is built to **scale and handle complex pipelines** that outgrow ksqlDB’s scope ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=Resources)).

From a **learning perspective**, ksqlDB’s SQL is simpler but also restrictive – you might quickly hit its limits. RisingWave’s SQL is richer, which might require understanding more SQL features but ultimately empowers more. In terms of performance, both can achieve high throughput, but if data relationships get complex or if you want to join Kafka streams with non-Kafka data in real-time, RisingWave is clearly more capable.

To put it succinctly: If your streaming data architecture is centered on Kafka and you need a quick, simple way to transform streams with SQL, ksqlDB can do the job for straightforward tasks. But if you need a **full-fledged streaming database that integrates with many systems, supports advanced SQL, and scales out**, RisingWave is the more robust choice. It provides a **“seamlessly scalable” solution as your applications outgrow ksqlDB’s capabilities** ([RisingWave vs ksqlDB - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/risingwave-vs-ksqldb/#:~:text=Seamlessly%20Scale%20as%20Your%20Event,Applications%20Outgrow%20KsqlDB%20Capabilities)).

## Use Cases & Limitations

**Ideal Use Cases for RisingWave:** RisingWave shines in scenarios that demand **real-time analytics, continuous transformations, and low-latency responses** on fresh data. Some ideal applications include:

- **Streaming Analytics and Live Dashboards:** Any situation where data is continuously generated and you want **live analytical insight** is a great fit. For example, financial services can use RisingWave for **sub-second risk analytics, algorithmic trading monitoring, or fraud detection** – ingesting trade events or transactions and computing rolling metrics instantly ([Revolutionizing Capital Markets: How Solace PubSub+ and RisingWave Power Millisecond-Precision Trading at Scale | by RisingWave Labs | Mar, 2025 | Towards Dev](https://towardsdev.com/revolutionizing-capital-markets-how-solace-pubsub-and-risingwave-power-millisecond-precision-e6fdff80b102#:~:text=RisingWave%20in%20capital%20markets)) ([Revolutionizing Capital Markets: How Solace PubSub+ and RisingWave Power Millisecond-Precision Trading at Scale | by RisingWave Labs | Mar, 2025 | Towards Dev](https://towardsdev.com/revolutionizing-capital-markets-how-solace-pubsub-and-risingwave-power-millisecond-precision-e6fdff80b102#:~:text=RisingWave%20transforms%20capital%20markets%2C%20enabling,for%20compliance%20and%20operational%20efficiency)). Similarly, online platforms can maintain **real-time dashboards** for product analytics, user behavior, or IoT sensor readings. RisingWave’s ability to maintain materialized views means dashboard charts can always query the latest aggregates (e.g., active users in the last 5 minutes, or IoT sensor averages per minute). The documentation notes it is ideal for high-stakes scenarios like **stock trading, sports betting, and IoT monitoring where sub-second data freshness** is needed ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20particularly%20effective%20for,the%20following%20use%20cases)).

- **Monitoring and Alerting Systems:** RisingWave can underpin **event-driven applications** such as monitoring pipelines that detect anomalies or trigger alerts on certain conditions in real time ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=monitoring.%20%2A%20Event,ensuring%20seamless%20integration%20and%20consistency)). For instance, an application performance monitoring system could feed logs into RisingWave and maintain views of error rates or latencies by service, triggering alerts when thresholds are exceeded. Because RisingWave supports window aggregations and joins, you can express complex alert conditions (e.g., "alert if error rate in 5-min window exceeds baseline by X and user count > Y"). It simplifies building **fraud detection**, **intrusion detection**, or **operational monitoring** tools where you need to continuously evaluate streams of events and react quickly.

- **Real-Time ETL / Pipeline Simplification:** RisingWave can be used to perform **continuous ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)**, i.e., cleaning, joining, and enriching data streams and then delivering the results to other systems ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=monitoring.%20%2A%20Event,ensuring%20seamless%20integration%20and%20consistency)). For example, you might use RisingWave to join a clickstream with user profile data (from a database) and output an enriched stream to a data warehouse or lake. Traditionally this might require multiple components (Kafka + Flink + DB), but RisingWave can do it internally: ingest from OLTP CDC and message streams, do transformations in SQL, then sink to a Snowflake, BigQuery, or Iceberg table. This is essentially **streaming data pipeline consolidation**. The docs mention using it to “continuously ingest data from diverse sources, do real-time enrichment, and efficiently deliver results to downstream systems” ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=monitoring.%20%2A%20Event,ensuring%20seamless%20integration%20and%20consistency)) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=systems%20for%20critical%20applications%20such,the%20results%20to%20downstream%20systems)). One concrete example is **syncing database changes into an analytics lakehouse** – RisingWave can read MySQL binlogs, join with reference data, and write to an Apache Iceberg table in S3, all in one flow (they even have a product name for this: “Streaming Lakehouse” ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=RisingWave%20Overview%20The%20technical%20tour,your%20existing%20databases%20%208))).

- **Real-Time Feature Engineering for ML:** Because it can unify batch and streaming, RisingWave can be used in **feature store pipelines** to compute features in real-time. For instance, processing streaming events to update aggregate features (counts, averages, last event time) for each user or device, which are then used by online machine learning models for predictions. The materialized view mechanism is a natural way to maintain features incrementally. RisingWave was shown to make building feature stores effortless by handling the continuous aggregation with SQL and ensuring consistency ([Build Feature Stores Effortlessly with RisingWave](https://risingwave.com/blog/build-feature-stores-effortlessly-with-risingwave/#:~:text=Build%20Feature%20Stores%20Effortlessly%20with,Based%20on%20the%20above)). The result can be served to ML models directly from RisingWave or exported to a feature store service.

- **Hybrid “Streaming + Historical” querying:** Applications that need to combine live data with historical (backfill) data seamlessly. RisingWave can ingest static historical data (from files or databases) and live updates, allowing queries that **join “what happened before” with “what’s happening now.”** For example, an e-commerce analytics system might join today’s orders stream with a table of last month’s orders to compute relative change in real time. RisingWave’s ability to handle both streaming and stored data in one system enables these **hybrid queries** which are difficult to achieve otherwise without complex lambda architecture.

- **Time-series and IoT data management:** It can act as a time-series database for fast-moving data. IoT sensor hubs, telemetry systems, or network logs can stream into RisingWave, which can handle time-windowed computations (like moving averages, peak detection) and also store the raw or down-sampled data. The **time travel** query feature is useful here for auditing and debugging what values were at a certain time, and **as-of joins** can help correlate multiple sensor streams by time. RisingWave might not be as specialized as a time-series DB like InfluxDB in terms of compression, but it provides the real-time computation and SQL interface that many TSDBs lack, along with integration to other systems.

- **Continuous Data Synchronization / CDC-based applications:** Use RisingWave to **continuously sync data** between sources. For instance, perform **change data capture from Postgres** and feed into analytics or trigger downstream actions. RisingWave can maintain a materialized view that is essentially a replica or a transformed version of an upstream table in real-time, possibly reducing reliance on separate CDC tools. With its **schema evolution** support for CDC sources ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v21-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database/#:~:text=Auto%20schema%20change%20for%20Postgres,to%20Know%20about%20RisingWave%20Premium)) ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v21-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database/#:~:text=RisingWave%20now%20supports%20automatic%20schema,update%20to%20reflect%20the%20change)), it’s appealing for maintaining up-to-date replicas for microservices or caching.

Given these, typical **industries** that benefit are **financial services (capital markets risk, digital banking analytics)** ([Revolutionizing Capital Markets: How Solace PubSub+ and RisingWave Power Millisecond-Precision Trading at Scale | by RisingWave Labs | Mar, 2025 | Towards Dev](https://towardsdev.com/revolutionizing-capital-markets-how-solace-pubsub-and-risingwave-power-millisecond-precision-e6fdff80b102#:~:text=RisingWave%20in%20capital%20markets)), **ad-tech and marketing (real-time click and conversion tracking)**, **e-commerce (live inventory and pricing adjustments)**, **telecom (network event monitoring)**, **manufacturing (IoT sensor analytics)**, etc. Indeed, RisingWave’s site lists use cases by industry such as real-time bidding in AdTech, personalized recommendations, operational monitoring in healthcare, etc., all of which correspond to using streaming SQL for immediate insights ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20RW)) ([RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20RW)).

**Known Limitations and Trade-offs:** While RisingWave is powerful, it is not a silver bullet for every scenario. Some limitations or areas where it may not be the best fit:

- **Not a Replacement for OLTP Databases:** RisingWave is **not designed for transactional, row-by-row updates or a high-concurrency OLTP workload**. It does **not support general read-write transactions** (no multi-statement transactions or foreign key enforcement across tables, etc.) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20PostgreSQL%20wire,events%20rather%20than%20transactional%20data)). You can do individual INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, but these are treated as streaming events and are not fully transactional; there’s also a caveat that if the system crashes before those are checkpointed, data could be lost (until a proper WAL is implemented) ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=DML%20statements%2C%20including%20INSERT%2F%20UPDATE%2F,loss%20and%20better%20data%20management)) ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=manually%20modifying%20data,loss%20and%20better%20data%20management)). So, you wouldn’t use RisingWave as your primary system of record for frequent updates – an operational database (Postgres, etc.) is still needed for that. In fact, the recommended pattern is to keep OLTP in an operational DB and feed changes to RisingWave for analytical purposes ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Operational%20databases)) ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=RisingWave%20is%20PostgreSQL%20wire,events%20rather%20than%20transactional%20data)). If you issue ad-hoc INSERTs directly into RisingWave (not via a connector), you should be aware of durability issues (until future releases bring a write-ahead log) ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=DML%20statements%2C%20including%20INSERT%2F%20UPDATE%2F,loss%20and%20better%20data%20management)) ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=manually%20modifying%20data,loss%20and%20better%20data%20management)).

- **Ad-hoc Analytical Queries on Cold Data:** RisingWave does not use columnar storage or advanced indexing for arbitrary ad-hoc queries over huge historical datasets ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=mechanisms%20are%20superior%20to%20other,analytical%20databases)). If your workload is mostly **long, exploratory SQL queries over static historical data** (like a data warehouse scenario), a dedicated OLAP database (Snowflake, ClickHouse, etc.) might outperform it. RisingWave is optimized for defined **continuous queries and point/range lookups** on results, rather than heavy scan-based queries. The docs explicitly note that since it doesn’t have columnar storage, if you mostly do ad-hoc long-range scans, an analytical DB might be a better fit ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=mechanisms%20are%20superior%20to%20other,analytical%20databases)). In practice, you can still run big queries on RisingWave (it will use its batch mode), but expect higher latency than a columnar-optimized system for those specific workloads.

- **Latency vs Throughput Tradeoff:** RisingWave targets sub-second to second-level latencies for results, which is sufficient for dashboards and alerts. But it’s not aiming for microsecond latencies. Systems like Apache Kafka Streams or specialized CEP engines might have lower per-event latency (at the cost of less flexibility). RisingWave’s default 1-second checkpoint interval means it’s comfortable with that magnitude of delay for global consistency. So for ultra-low latency event processing (like per-message processing with <10 ms end-to-end), RisingWave might not be the best – it’s more for analytics latency (fractions of a second to a few seconds).

- **Feature Gaps (as of current version):** Being a fast-evolving project, some SQL features might still be missing or experimental. For instance, as of v2.0, **session window** support was not there yet ([The Preview of Stream Processing Performance Report: Apache Flink and RisingWave Comparison  - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/the-preview-of-stream-processing-performance-report-apache-flink-and-risingwave-comparison/#:~:text=,Since%20our)) (though tumbling/hopping are). Some complex types like GIS or full-text search aren’t supported (not typical in streaming SQL anyway). **Ordered semantic** output (like rank/window functions) might be limited – though they can often be expressed with time windows. Also, certain **PostgreSQL features** are not applicable: e.g., no foreign keys, no user-defined index creation (the system manages its own indexes internally), no triggers. Another limitation: **no distributed joins across disparate data sources on the fly** (you have to ingest data into RisingWave first; it’s not a federated query engine). So you wouldn’t point RisingWave at two external databases and join them (you’d use a proper federation tool or ingest both into RisingWave).

- **Maturity and Stability:** While already production-used, RisingWave is relatively young. There may be rough edges or performance tuning needed for extreme workloads. Users might encounter bugs or need to tune things like checkpoint intervals, memory for compactor cache, etc. The team is active in releasing fixes, but adopters should test thoroughly for their specific workload patterns. Features like the **WAL** are planned for future to ensure absolutely no data loss on crash for user inserts ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=DML%20statements%2C%20including%20INSERT%2F%20UPDATE%2F,loss%20and%20better%20data%20management)) ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=manually%20modifying%20data,loss%20and%20better%20data%20management)) – until then, one should either rely on connectors (which are exactly-once via checkpointing) or manually trigger flush after inserts if zero-loss is required.

- **Premium Edition Features:** Some capabilities (e.g., **auto schema evolution for Postgres source**) are marked as **Premium (enterprise)** ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v21-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database/#:~:text=Auto%20schema%20change)) ([RisingWave Labs Blog - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/highlights-of-risingwave-v21-the-open-source-streaming-sql-database/#:~:text=Auto%20schema%20change%20for%20Postgres,to%20Know%20about%20RisingWave%20Premium)). This indicates that the open-source version might lack a few enterprise conveniences that the company offers in a paid edition. It’s not a hard limitation of the technology, but something to note – if you need that feature and it’s only in Premium, the open source might not suffice. Nonetheless, core functionality remains in open source.

- **External Dependencies:** RisingWave itself relies on external storage (S3 or equivalent) for durability – so the performance characteristics and cost will depend on that. For on-premises deployments without cloud storage, one can use HDFS or even disk, but cloud object stores are the sweet spot. If for some reason you can’t use an object store and only local disk, you lose some of the disaggregation benefits (though RisingWave does support using an **“Elastic disk cache” on local disk plus remote storage** in combination ([What is RisingWave? - RisingWave](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/intro/#:~:text=Elastic%20disk%20cache))). Also, while RisingWave ensures exactly-once with sources, it assumes **source durability** – e.g., Kafka retention must be long enough to retry after fail, etc. If a source like Kinesis doesn’t retain data and RisingWave was down, data could be lost. This is common to all streaming systems but worth noting in production planning.

Despite these limitations, RisingWave is quite versatile. It’s best deployed where you have **continuous, high-volume data flows and need immediate insights or actions**. It may not replace your data warehouse for complex historical slicing/dicing, and it won’t replace a transactional DB for high-concurrency updates. But it will sit between those – consuming from OLTP and feeding OLAP – to provide the **real-time layer** of intelligence.

In practice, many users might use RisingWave to complement an OLAP database: for example, use RisingWave for the latest one hour of data with streaming updates, and use Snowflake/BigQuery for deeper historical queries beyond that. Or use it to power real-time features while the data lake catches up in batch later. The good news is that RisingWave’s integration (sinks to Iceberg, etc.) makes this **Lambda architecture** easier to maintain if needed.

## Deployment Models

RisingWave was built with cloud-native deployment in mind, and it offers flexible ways to run it:

- **Self-Hosted (On-Prem or Cloud VM):** You can deploy RisingWave on your own infrastructure, either on VMs or bare metal, by running its components (Meta node, compute nodes, compactor nodes). The project provides Docker images and a simple way to get started. For development or small-scale use, **Docker Compose** can spin up a local RisingWave cluster (all components on one machine or a few machines) ([Start RisingWave using Docker Compose](https://docs.risingwave.com/deploy/risingwave-docker-compose#:~:text=Start%20RisingWave%20using%20Docker%20Compose,in%20your%20preferred%20storage%20service)) ([Start RisingWave using Docker Compose](https://docs.risingwave.com/deploy/risingwave-docker-compose#:~:text=Start%20RisingWave%20using%20Docker%20Compose,in%20your%20preferred%20storage%20service)). This is great for a quick trial or testing some queries locally. For production, one would likely run each component on separate servers or containers for resiliency and scale.

- **Kubernetes Operator and Helm:** RisingWave has first-class support for Kubernetes deployment. They provide a **Helm chart** to deploy a RisingWave cluster easily ([Deploy RisingWave on Kubernetes with Helm](https://docs.risingwave.com/deploy/risingwave-k8s-helm#:~:text=Deploy%20RisingWave%20on%20Kubernetes%20with,Helm%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fhelm.sh)), as well as a **Kubernetes Operator** (an operator is a controller that manages running a stateful application on K8s) ([Deploy RisingWave on Kubernetes with Operator](https://docs.risingwave.com/deploy/risingwave-kubernetes#:~:text=Deploy%20RisingWave%20on%20Kubernetes%20with,a%20RisingWave%20cluster%20in%20Kubernetes)). The official RisingWave Operator can set up the meta, compute, compactor nodes as Kubernetes pods and handle scaling them, upgrades, etc. This makes it straightforward to run on any cloud Kubernetes service or on-prem K8s. For instance, using the Helm chart one can configure the number of each node type, storage settings (like pointing to S3 credentials), and monitoring. The Docker Hub image suggests that for production, using either **RisingWave Cloud (managed) or deploying on Kubernetes via Operator/Helm** is recommended ([risingwavelabs/risingwave - Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/risingwavelabs/risingwave#:~:text=risingwavelabs%2Frisingwave%20,Usage)). This implies the project is optimized for that scenario. Many users will likely go the K8s route for its easy scaling and management of a distributed system.

- **Managed Cloud Service (RisingWave Cloud):** RisingWave Labs offers **RisingWave Cloud**, a fully managed service where they host the cluster for you. This is similar to how companies offer managed databases. With RisingWave Cloud, you don’t worry about the infra – you get an endpoint and web console to create projects, define connectors, etc. It’s likely hosted on AWS (and possibly other clouds) and abstracts away the details of meta/compute/compactor nodes. According to the FAQ, RisingWave Cloud **provides all the functionality of RisingWave in a managed deployment**, simplifying operation and maintenance ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=What%20is%20RisingWave%20Cloud%3F)) ([Frequently Asked Questions - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database - RisingWave: Open-Source Streaming Database](https://risingwave.com/faq/#:~:text=RisingWave%20Cloud%20provides%20all%20the,downstream%20systems%20on%20the%20cloud)). Users can connect to various upstream/downstream systems in cloud through it, and presumably the service takes care of scaling, patching, and recovery. The Cloud is a convenient option if one doesn’t want to run it themselves – also supported by the fact that a **Terraform provider** exists**(Note: The content ended abruptly, likely due to a tool or instruction confusion. I will now finalize the answer with the remaining sections, ensuring continuity and completeness.)**

... (Continuing from Deployment Models)

Beyond Kubernetes, some users might deploy RisingWave on cloud VMs or container services manually. The **risingwave binary** can run in either **standalone mode** (all in one for dev) or cluster mode. For cluster mode, you run one process as meta node (`risingwave meta`) and others as compute (`risingwave compute`) and compactor (`risingwave compactor`). These communicate typically via gRPC. The config allows pointing to an object storage bucket (like S3, GCS, etc.) for persistence. The **Helm chart** likely encapsulates this configuration.

**Terraform and IaC:** As search results indicate, there's a **Terraform provider for RisingWave Cloud**. This lets you manage RisingWave clusters and resources as code if using the managed service. There's also mention of an internal Terraform module used by RisingWave for deploying on AWS (which suggests they have infrastructure scripts for EC2 deployments too).

**Containerization:** The official **Docker image** is on Docker Hub (risingwavelabs/risingwave). It's multi-purpose (the same image can be a meta or compute node based on entrypoint arguments). So one can orchestrate a cluster with Docker Compose or manual container runs. But for reliability, using the operator or at least docker-compose with proper volume mounts for cache might be needed.

**Cloud vs On-Prem:** RisingWave can run on-premises (with something like MinIO or HDFS as the object store, if not using S3). It’s cloud-agnostic in that sense: as long as it has a storage backend, it can run anywhere. In Kubernetes, one could use local PV or NFS for the object storage in a pinch, but cloud object storage is recommended for HA.

In summary, **Deployment Options:**

- *Managed (RisingWave Cloud):* Easiest, but costs money. Good for quick adoption or production without in-house ops.
- *Self-Managed on Kubernetes:* Most common for users wanting control. Use the official operator or Helm for easier setup and scaling.
- *Self-Managed on VMs/Bare Metal:* Feasible but requires manually managing processes or using an orchestrator like Nomad. Possibly use docker-compose for a single node cluster or manual configs for multi-node.
- *Docker for Dev:* E.g., one-liner to run RisingWave: `docker run -p 4566:4566 risingwavelabs/risingwave:latest` might start a standalone (I recall their quickstart using a shell script to curl an installer).

**CLI and Tools:** There's likely a `risedev` CLI or config (I saw mention of `risedev.yml`) used for development by the team. For users, standard tools like `psql` are used to interact with the cluster. Also, integration with **psycopg2, SQLAlchemy, Ibis** is mentioned, enabling programmatic access.

**Kubernetes Scaling:** The operator can handle scaling compute and compactor nodes independently. If workload grows, one can scale out compute nodes to increase parallel processing slots, and if data volume grows, possibly add more compactor nodes to handle compaction throughput (compactors can become a bottleneck if too few and lots of data). The meta node is typically single (with a standby maybe for HA in future versions, not sure if meta HA is available yet or if that's enterprise feature). On managed cloud, they likely have a way to replicate meta or use etcd behind the scenes.

## Durability & Fault Tolerance

RisingWave is built with **fault tolerance and durability** from the ground up. It treats **data durability** as a core feature, unlike some streaming systems that focus only on processing.

**Checkpointing and Recovery:** RisingWave adopts the classic **Chandy-Lamport distributed snapshot algorithm** for consistent checkpoints. This means periodically (by default every 1 second), a **global barrier** is injected into the data stream, marking a checkpoint. When all operators have received the barrier, the system takes a snapshot of their state. All state changes (deltas) since the last checkpoint are flushed to the **durable remote storage** (like S3). The result is a **global consistent state** representing the entire streaming pipeline at that point in time. The checkpoint includes source offsets, contents of stateful operators (aggregates, join maps, etc.), and materialized view tables.

If a node crashes or the whole system goes down, RisingWave can **recover by restoring the latest checkpoint**. On recovery, the meta node assigns operators to nodes, and each operator **reloads its state** from the snapshot in storage. Then source connectors resume reading from the last checkpointed offsets, so no data is processed twice or lost (ensuring exactly-once semantics). Because checkpoints are frequent (1s), the amount of reprocessing after a crash is minimal – at most 1 second of data might need to be re-read (which in worst case might cause duplicate outputs if an external sink doesn’t deduplicate, but if the sink is also integrated with checkpointing, it's exactly-once end-to-end). The design aim is that **failure recovery causes almost no noticeable delay**: since state is restored instead of recomputed from scratch, the system can be back online in a few seconds. For example, if ingesting for 24 hours and a failure happens, it will *not* replay 24 hours of data, only from the last second checkpoint.

**Durable Storage Model:** As noted, RisingWave uses a **remote object storage (e.g., S3)** as its primary persistent storage for state. Every table or materialized view’s data is stored as SSTable files in the object store. This ensures that even if all live nodes fail, the data remains safe in S3 (which is highly durable itself). RisingWave **does not rely on in-memory replication** for durability, which is good because an in-memory failure could lose state. Instead, the combination of frequent flushes and remote storage gives a strong durability guarantee (S3, GCS, etc., typically have 99.999999999% durability).

For performance, RisingWave augments this with an **Elastic Disk Cache** feature. This means each compute node can use its local SSD/disk as a cache for state. Recent or hot data stays in local cache (either memory or disk), avoiding repeated access to S3, which would be slow. But if a node fails, that local cache can be rebuilt from S3. This is similar to how modern cloud data warehouses use S3 for base storage and local SSD for caching (e.g., Snowflake’s approach). It **minimizes S3 reads** and improves latency, while still keeping durability because S3 (or equivalent) is the source of truth. The cache is "elastic" in that you can allocate more disk to improve cache hit rates.

**Exactly-Once Guarantees:** RisingWave ensures that for each input event, its effects are reflected **exactly once** in the materialized views and outputs, even in face of failures. The checkpoint mechanism aligns with this: when recovery happens, any partial progress beyond the last checkpoint is discarded, and processing resumes idempotently from the checkpoint. The combination of checkpointed source offsets and state means no duplicates or gaps. As the docs say, “for read queries, data is always fetched from the last checkpoint” to ensure consistency. For writes, “if a failure occurs, only the states not saved to the upcoming checkpoint are lost” – which essentially is like saying we roll back to the last committed snapshot (like a transaction that spans each checkpoint interval). With a 1s interval, losing 1s of data in worst case might sound like at-least-once, but those events would still be in the source (like Kafka) and thus be processed after recovery (hence exactly-once, as they get reprocessed, not lost). The only caveat was with manual inserts not being checkpointed – but if using proper streaming ingest, it's exactly-once.

**Consistency:** RisingWave’s **MVCC** (multi-version concurrency control) storage means it can serve queries consistent with a snapshot. It uses a **visibility map per data chunk** and an `ops` column in stream chunks to mark inserts/deletes, etc.. This implies that even as new data is streaming in, an ongoing read query will see a stable view of the data (likely as of the last checkpoint or last committed epoch). They likely implement **epoch-based MVCC** where each barrier increments an epoch, and queries are tied to an epoch.

**Replication and Consensus:** There is the question of how the **Meta node** is handled for high availability. The meta node is a single point for coordination. Some systems use consensus (like Zookeeper/etcd or Raft) to make that fault-tolerant. It's not explicitly stated, but RisingWave may embed etcd or have some consensus mechanism to persist metadata. The open-source version might not have meta HA yet (some such systems require manual restart of meta). However, the meta’s info could also be in the object store or durable in some way, so that if meta restarts, it can reconstruct cluster state from what’s persisted. Given the project maturity, it's possible the meta is persistent (maybe writing to object storage or a small sqlite file on disk). In any event, the meta primarily holds relatively static info (table schemas, stream graphs, cluster topology). If meta fails, the data still flows but no new queries or reconfiguration can happen until it’s back. Running meta in a redundant way (like two meta nodes, one active one standby) would be ideal – that might be a premium feature or an upcoming one.

**Data Retention:** By default, RisingWave doesn’t infinitely retain all streams – it keeps state needed for current materialized views. If you want to keep raw data forever, you’d typically sink it to a data lake. For durability of **output results**, you rely on either querying the MVs in RisingWave (which are persisted) or sinking them to an external store. If RisingWave had to restart, as long as you have the state (which includes all MVs), you can again serve queries. If you drop a materialized view, that data is gone unless it was also delivered elsewhere.

**No WAL (Yet):** The FAQ notes that a write-ahead log is planned. A WAL would guarantee that even manual inserts are not lost on crash. In the meantime, the durability model relies entirely on checkpointing. So if a user inserts a value and a crash happens 0.5s later before a checkpoint, that value might be lost (unless FLUSH was called). This is a small window and only affects non-streaming sources. Streaming connectors usually continuously commit offsets.

**Failure Scenarios and Handling:**

- *Node Failure (Compute):* If a compute node dies, the meta detects it (heartbeat lost). It will reassign that node’s tasks (fragments of the query plan) to another available node, which will then load state from storage (via compactor). Because state is partitioned, ideally only the lost node’s partition of state needs loading. The system then continues processing after a short pause. The recovery from node failure is part of the "instant failure recovery in seconds" highlighted by RisingWave.

- *Node Failure (Compactor):* If a compactor node fails, the object store is still safe; the meta can assign compaction tasks to another compactor. If a compactor was in the middle of writing an SST file, either the operation is retried or partial files are cleaned up through some mechanism. Usually, since object storage writes are atomic or use temp naming until complete, it should be fine.

- *Meta Failure:* If meta fails, likely the cluster halts processing new stuff until meta is back. On restart, it reads the catalog (maybe from a backup or from the object store which possibly also holds some metadata). Redundancy for meta could be achieved by running multiple metas with leader election (like a Raft group). If that’s not implemented, one must treat meta as a critical node to keep running (maybe run it on an instance with high reliability or use keepalived, etc., if needed).

- *Network partitions:* If a compute node is alive but network partitioned from meta, meta will mark it as down and reassign tasks. When the partition heals, the old compute might try to rejoin; having a robust membership and task management (likely via meta’s control) will ensure at most one active copy. If two copies ended up processing, consistency might break, but careful design avoids that (barriers ensure one active pipeline).

**Data Integrity:** The use of **append-only logs and MVCC** ensures that even during updates, the system can reconstruct a consistent view. The MVCC design implicitly provides **time travel** and multi-version reads without locking streams.

**Durability of Input Data:** RisingWave relies on sources for durability of input. For example, if you are ingesting from Kafka, as long as Kafka retains the messages until RisingWave checkpointed them, the system is fine. If RisingWave is down for longer than Kafka’s retention and loses its checkpoint offset, then some data could vanish. So in production, ensure source retention is configured safely or use sources like databases that have full history (like database CDC from a WAL).

**Incremental Checkpoints and Compaction:** The docs mention that **checkpoints are incremental** and behind the scenes, compaction tasks run to merge state and reclaim space. This means RisingWave doesn't create a brand new full snapshot of all data every second (that would be too slow), it likely uses an **incremental checkpoint** approach where only changes since last checkpoint are written, and the object store has multiple versions. Periodically, compaction will merge those changes into a new base. This is similar to Flink's incremental checkpointing. It ensures that recovery is fast (just apply last diff if needed) and storage overhead is controlled.

**Replication:** It's worth noting that RisingWave does not (in open-source) replicate state to multiple nodes live (like no in-memory replication across compute nodes). It relies on the remote store as the single source of persistence (which itself is typically triple replicated in cloud). One might consider the compactor nodes as a kind of replication if multiple are writing to the same bucket (each one does parts, but the data is in one store). For those paranoid about availability, one could use multi-region S3 or replicate S3 to another region – but these are usually beyond what a DB handles natively.

In conclusion, RisingWave’s durability and fault tolerance story is robust and in line with modern streaming systems: **durable remote storage + frequent global checkpoints = highly reliable, exactly-once stateful processing**. This approach trades a bit of runtime overhead (writing state to storage frequently) for strong guarantees – a wise trade for most enterprise scenarios. It ensures that queries see consistent results and that the system can recover quickly from crashes without manual intervention. The intention to add a WAL will only strengthen it, making even out-of-band writes safe. For now, as long as you use connectors or commit manual writes with FLUSH, you get near OLTP-level durability.

## Project Activity

RisingWave is a relatively young project but has seen **rapid development** and growing community engagement. Here are some insights into its project activity and evolution:

- **Open Source Timeline:** RisingWave was open-sourced by RisingWave Labs (formerly Singularity Data) likely in 2022. By early 2023, it had gained traction, with many GitHub stars and active discussions (the founder answering questions on GitHub in April 2022 suggests it was already public then). Since then, the team has been **iterating quickly**, with frequent releases (almost monthly minor releases).

- **Recent Releases:** The version numbers indicate that as of late 2024, RisingWave reached **v2.0** (released Sep 2024). After that, **v2.1** came out around Dec 2024 and **v2.2** in Feb 2025. These releases add significant features and improvements:
  - **v2.0 Highlights (Sep 2024):** Introduced **Time Travel queries** (`FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF`), the ability to securely store credentials (likely via new SQL commands for secrets), new sink connectors (Parquet format, etc.), improved Python UDFs, and **a new Python SDK**. It also included breaking changes to subscription cursors (changing how incremental vs full data is fetched). Essentially, by 2.0, the project matured in ecosystem support, adding features that enterprise users want (like time travel and easier ext. connections).
  - **v2.1 Highlights (Dec 2024):** Focus on **connectors and ease of use**. For example, added **schemaless ingestion** (the `INCLUDE payload` for Kafka sources), **PostgreSQL table-valued function `postgres_query`** (to pull data from Postgres on demand), and **support for Postgres partitioned tables** in CDC. Also **automatic schema change** (Premium) for Postgres CDC sources. Added **WebHDFS sink** to integrate with Hadoop environments. These features show expanding integration and enterprise readiness.
  - **v2.2 Highlights (Feb 2025):** Added **Reusable Connections** (so you can define one Kafka connection and reuse it for multiple sources/sinks), a new **Webhook source connector** for ingesting events via HTTP triggers, **new SQL functions**, and likely other performance improvements. The focus is on convenience (connections) and new integration methods (webhook).
  - We might expect a **v2.3 or v3.0** later in 2025 with further enhancements (perhaps WAL, more SQL features, etc.).

- **Active Contributors:** RisingWave Labs is the main driver, with **Yingjun Wu** (CEO/founder) actively involved (he responds on GitHub discussions). Other core contributors likely include team members with database and streaming backgrounds. The GitHub repo shows frequent commits and issues, implying an active engineering team. The Slack community (7.6k invites shown on site) suggests a decent user and developer community.

As of now, the GitHub stars are ~7.6k (as indicated on the site header), which is quite high for a project of ~2 years old, indicating strong interest. The presence of **community discussions, blog posts, and a monthly newsletter** also show the project is engaging with users.

- **Governance Model:** RisingWave is not (yet) part of a foundation or multi-company governance. It is stewarded by RisingWave Labs (the company). However, being Apache 2.0, outside contributions are welcome. The company likely controls major decisions, but as adoption grows, they may consider foundation governance (for now, they’re funded and likely prefer to guide it closely). There’s a **premium edition** mentioned, implying an open core model: core features open, some enterprise features closed.

- **Funding and Company Backing:** RisingWave Labs is the company behind it, based in SF (address given on site). They raised a **$36M Series A in Oct 2022** led by Yunqi Partners and others, bringing total funding to $40M. The TechCrunch article notes they were launching RisingWave Cloud with that funding. As per search, there might have been a Series B or additional funding in Feb 2025 (though Tracxn suggests still $40M total, perhaps Series B not publicly announced by then, or the company focusing on growth from A). The founder’s background: Yingjun Wu has a decade in database/streaming, worked on Amazon Redshift, etc., which likely influences RisingWave’s approach. The company’s mission is clearly to **productize RisingWave for enterprise use**, offering both open-source and cloud.

- **Community Growth:** There’s a presence on **Reddit (risingwave)**, Medium (RisingWave Labs publication), and developer talks. E.g., a “RisingWave vs. Flink webinar” was listed. Being Postgres-compatible also opens doors to the Postgres community (for example, showing up in lists of top streaming databases).

- **Release Notes and Changelog:** The official docs have a changelog page, summarizing changes each version. This is maintained likely with each minor/major release. The  release cadence in late 2024 seems roughly quarterly. Possibly patch releases in between for bug fixes.

- **Issues and Roadmap:** The GitHub issues and milestones show e.g., a “release-2.1” milestone with many tasks, which was 92% complete by a date (means they plan for versions ahead). The presence of an issue for “Materialize comparison #1736” shows they pay attention to community questions and differentiate from competitors. For roadmap beyond 2.2, likely items include:
  - Full **transactional WAL** and exactly-once for user writes.
  - More **window types** (session windows, etc.).
  - Additional connectors (maybe Azure EventHub, Google PubSub, etc.).
  - **More SQL coverage:** window functions (ROW_NUMBER etc.), maybe more built-in UDFs or library integration, etc.
  - Further **performance optimizations** (maybe vectorized execution improvements, GPU offloading? speculation).
  - Possibly **multi-tenant support** (so one cluster can serve multiple projects securely).
  - **Meta node HA** (if not already).
  - Better **monitoring/observability** tools (although they have Prometheus metrics, they might integrate with Grafana or provide UI).
  
The fact that they have blog posts like “Highlights of vX.Y” for each minor version indicates an active marketing and documentation effort to keep users informed.

**Community**: There's a Slack community, and presumably, users from companies like those listed (Siemens, Tencent, etc.) might be participants, giving feedback and sharing use cases. The presence of RisingWave on **DBEngines ranking** (maybe not high yet, but they've been listed in comparisons on sites like Slashdot and SourceForge) suggests growing recognition.

**Comparative positioning**: RisingWave often appears in lists of streaming databases alongside Materialize, ksqlDB, etc., and being praised for PostgreSQL compatibility and cost-efficiency. The medium blogs and external articles (like TechTarget) highlight its open-source nature and funding.

So the trajectory is positive: **fast-paced development, robust funding, and an active push to build a user base**. This momentum points to a vibrant future for the project in the streaming database niche.

## Real-World Adoption

RisingWave, despite being relatively new, has already seen adoption in various **real-world projects** and companies, as evidenced by references on their site and elsewhere:

- **Notable Users and Case Studies:** The website front page mentions it’s “Trusted by 1,000+ data-driven organizations”, with logos like **Siemens, Robinhood, Tencent, Henkel, Kaito, ThreatMark, CVTE** etc.. These are big names:
  - *Siemens* (industrial/manufacturing, likely using RisingWave for IoT sensor streaming or real-time analytics in factories).
  - *Robinhood* (fintech, stock trading app – real-time market data analysis and monitoring is a classic case for RisingWave’s low latency streaming SQL).
  - *Tencent* (tech giant, could be using it for gaming telemetry or social media event processing).
  - *Henkel* (consumer goods, maybe for supply chain or e-commerce analytics).
  - *ThreatMark* (cybersecurity, possibly analyzing event streams for fraud/anomaly detection).
  - *Metabit Trading* (a trading firm, likely doing high-frequency trading analytics with it).
  - *Neuron* (not sure, but could be IoT or AI startup).
  - *CVTE* (a tech company, maybe for streaming data integration).
  
  These logos indicate RisingWave has been tried or used in production by companies across finance, tech, manufacturing, cybersecurity, etc. It’s possible some of these are RisingWave Cloud customers or they have deployed open-source in pilot projects.

- **Case Studies/Blogs:** There is at least one external blog "Revolutionizing Capital Markets: How Solace PubSub+ and RisingWave..." on Towards Dev. This appears to detail how RisingWave is used with a message broker (Solace) to power a trading analytics application with millisecond precision. It underscores RisingWave’s application in a **financial trading context** – portfolio risk management and monitoring exposures in real time. It mentions **materialized views auto-refreshing exposure metrics** and integration with Kafka/Solace for sliding window analytics. This is essentially a testimonial that RisingWave can handle the demands of capital markets data streams.

- **Integrations:** RisingWave integrates with popular tools: for instance, outputting to Grafana or reading from MySQL binlog via Debezium. In one Reddit comment or blog, it was mentioned to integrate with Grafana Cloud, etc. So some teams likely use it to feed real-time dashboards (Grafana, Superset, etc.). The compatibility with Postgres means any BI tool (Tableau, etc.) can connect if needed to query a materialized view for live metrics.

- **Benchmarks:** There is mention of **Nexmark benchmark** results, which suggests RisingWave has been put to test on a standard streaming benchmark (Nexmark simulates an online auction system). If those results are public (maybe in a blog or whitepaper), they presumably show RisingWave performing strongly vs. Flink. The fact that RisingWave team published a "preview" of that performance report means they are confident in its performance.

- **Testimonials:** While not explicitly quoted, the presence of brand logos and the content in blogs serve as indirect testimonials. For example, in the capital markets blog, they write how RisingWave "ensures financial institutions can dynamically assess portfolio exposures... with timely alerts and automated adjustments" – likely reflecting actual benefits seen by a user in that domain. They also highlight how it simplifies workflows by removing error-prone batch pipelines.

- **Open Source Community**: On Hacker News and Reddit, discussions around RisingWave often include early adopters comparing it to alternatives. There's a Reddit thread (dataengineering) where RisingWave benchmarks were posted. Some comments likely discussed their experience. Also a HN thread mentions "Proton, RisingWave, Materialize etc are alternatives..." which shows risingwave is on the radar of cutting-edge data engineers.

- **Partnerships:** Not explicitly mentioned, but integration with certain technologies could hint at partnerships. E.g., official support for Redpanda or Pulsar might mean they collaborated. Also presence on AWS Marketplace for RisingWave Cloud suggests collaboration with AWS.

- **GitHub users:** Looking at who stars or forks the repo can indicate interest. With 7k stars, many individuals from companies likely tried it. The Slack community presumably has channels where some share how they use it (maybe one for use-case sharing).

- **Training and Talks:** There might have been conference talks or webinars by RisingWave Labs or by users. For example, a live webinar "RisingWave vs Flink – Who's Better?" indicates they are reaching out to potential users through comparisons and education, possibly with Q&A where users share feedback.

- **Adoption Patterns:** It's likely many users start by using RisingWave as a **complement to Kafka** (pull from Kafka, do some light processing that was hard in ksqlDB) or as a **replacement for custom Flink jobs** that were too hard to maintain. Over time they might extend it to more pipelines. Real world adoption often starts with a targeted use-case like "we need a live dashboard for this metric" and grows from there.

- **Metrics & Monitoring use-case:** Because they wrote a blog about exporting metrics from RisingWave Cloud to customer monitoring, it implies some enterprise customers requested that. They mention enabling enterprise customers to export monitoring metrics of their clusters to their own stack (April 2024 LinkedIn news). So actual enterprise usage was happening by early 2024 to drive those features.

- **Benchmarks by Users:** There's an item "Benchmarking Materialized Views of SQL-based ..." including ksqlDB, Materialize, Flink. If someone did an academic or independent benchmark including RisingWave, it indicates the interest in evaluating it. Perhaps that UniBo thesis or similar included RisingWave as well.

- **Industry acceptance:** The mention in TechCrunch and TechTarget show that the tech press acknowledges RisingWave as an upcoming player in streaming data. TechTarget's article (Oct 2022) said they plan to grow with new funding as the vendor looks to (some continuation likely "make streaming databases mainstream").

**Quotes/Testimonials:** If any formal quotes exist, they might be in press releases or on the site. The logos themselves and content like *"enabled us to do X in minutes instead of hours"* would be valuable, but none are explicitly given in the data we fetched. If none publicly, I'd rely on the scenario descriptions as pseudo-testimonials:

- e.g., *"RisingWave empowers portfolio managers to stay ahead of market shifts... by reducing latency and simplifying real-time processing with SQL, eliminating error-prone batch pipelines."* – though written by RisingWave Labs, it speaks to what their users in finance achieve.

**Case Example:** Suppose **Robinhood** uses RisingWave: they might ingest stock price streams and user trades to detect anomalies or do instant margin calculations. This could be a case where previously they needed Kafka + Spark Streaming, but RisingWave gave them a simpler, faster solution with just SQL.
Or **Siemens** could be using it in an IoT context: streaming sensor data from factory equipment to detect issues in real time, combining current sensor readings with maintenance logs (table) in an MV to predict failures (like a streaming join + ML UDF for anomaly).

Another sign of adoption is if RisingWave is **compared on DB-Engines or any ranking** – I see a search result about DocumentDB vs GeoMesa vs RisingWave on db-engines, which means it's listed there. That indicates enough interest to track it.

Given the above, it’s safe to say **RisingWave is being trialed or used in production by multiple industries for real-time analytics, and early feedback is positive, highlighting its simplicity and performance.** It's still emerging, so likely many more are in pilot phases. The presence of those big logos suggests at least some reference customers they can tout, which is a strong sign of trust in its capabilities.

## What Makes RisingWave Unique

RisingWave brings several **innovations and unique selling points** to the streaming data ecosystem:

- **Unified End-to-End Streaming Database:** The most striking uniqueness is that RisingWave is a **single system that handles everything from stream ingestion to query serving**. It breaks the mold of having separate components (Kafka for messaging, Flink for processing, Druid for serving, etc.) by offering a one-stop solution. This unified approach (ingest -> process -> store -> query) in one platform is still relatively rare. Competitors like Materialize do something similar, but RisingWave extends to distributed, cloud-scale and integrates storage. This eliminates complexity and latency that comes from stitching systems together. It also **simplifies the developer experience drastically** – no need to glue and maintain multiple systems.

- **Cloud-Native Architecture (Separation of Compute and Storage):** While some modern databases do this, in the streaming world RisingWave was one of the first to **apply the decoupled compute-storage paradigm** aggressively. By designing for S3 as primary storage, RisingWave achieves **10x cost efficiency** (their claim) and solves the scaling pain points of older streaming systems. This is a unique differentiator when comparing to frameworks like Flink or ksqlDB. It’s *the* reason RisingWave can recover so quickly and scale elastically. One can think of it as "Snowflake of streaming databases" in terms of architecture. The **compactor node concept** is an innovation combining ideas from LSM KV stores with streaming.

- **PostgreSQL Compatibility for Streaming:** RisingWave’s choice to be wire-compatible with Postgres is a practical yet impactful innovation. It’s not trivial to make a streaming engine speak Postgres protocol, but they did – enabling usage of all Postgres tools. This is unique because most streaming systems have their own API or SQL endpoint that is not Postgres-friendly (Materialize being an exception, but even it doesn’t allow writes or full PG syntax). **RisingWave basically appears as a Postgres database that magically updates its answers in real-time**. This means you can connect Tableau or any Postgres client to a live streaming view – bridging the gap between streaming data and existing BI ecosystems easily. That lowers adoption friction significantly.

- **Cascading Materialized Views (Composable Streaming Pipelines):** The ability to define multiple materialized views on top of one another in SQL and have the system efficiently manage the incremental updates is a strong innovation. **Composable multi-stage pipelines in SQL** are not possible in ksqlDB and not as straightforward in others. RisingWave’s support for this means complex logic can be broken down logically without performance penalty, which is a breakthrough for maintainability.

- **Time Travel Queries:** This feature is relatively unique in streaming databases. Traditional databases (like some data warehouses or Oracle Flashback) have time travel, but to do this on a streaming, continually updated dataset in a user-facing way is novel. Materialize doesn’t offer an explicit time travel, Flink cannot do this without external state storage, etc. RisingWave’s `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` is a standout innovation that gives users **direct access to historical states** in a straightforward manner. It essentially turns the streaming engine also into a temporal database (within retention). This bridging of streaming and temporal querying opens up new possibilities, like seamlessly debugging or auditing the streaming pipelines.

- **Built-in Connectors & Schema Evolution:** While connectors themselves aren’t a new invention (Flink has connectors, Kafka Connect exists), RisingWave having **built-in streaming connectors with backpressure awareness**, and features like **automated schema evolution** is a big quality-of-life improvement. It's unique that a database system auto-adjusts to upstream schema changes in a streaming context. This shows an emphasis on **resilience of pipelines to changes**, which is crucial in real-world data environments (schemas inevitably change). That level of automation reduces maintenance overhead significantly.

- **Stream-Table Unification and MVCC State Store:** The way RisingWave blends streams and tables through an MVCC key-value store is innovative. All data is in one engine – streams are just tables with an “append-only” mode plus deltas. The state store design with **multi-versioned LSM tree** is what enables both **concurrent reads (for queries and time travel)** and continuous writes. This is a break from, say, Flink where state is opaque and not queryable. **Exposing state via SQL** (materialized views) and handling it with MVCC is something pioneered by streaming databases like Materialize and now RisingWave, which is a new breed compared to older streaming engines.

- **High Performance with Modern Tech (Rust):** RisingWave’s implementation in Rust and a vectorized execution model gives it a performance edge. It's not unique to be in Rust (Materialize is too), but it’s at the forefront of a trend moving away from Java for stream processing, potentially achieving better CPU efficiency and memory safety. Rust also allows using modern concurrency, like async I/O for sources, etc. The vectorized processing akin to analytical DBs means it can exploit CPU cache better than tuple-at-a-time processing that some older engines do.

- **Focus on Cost Efficiency:** RisingWave’s marketing emphasizes **cost savings** – claiming up to 10x cost efficiency and showing that a leaner architecture can save cloud resources. For example, it claims to handle large joins without needing massive clusters (contrasting Flink needing to scale up for big RocksDB state). In an era of expensive cloud bills, this focus is a differentiator. If proven out, it's a unique advantage that you can do more with less hardware using RisingWave.

- **Simplified Event-Driven Architecture:** In a way, RisingWave is unique because it can replace pieces in an event-driven architecture, thus **simplifying the architecture itself**. The docs explicitly say it "simplifies event-driven architecture" by combining streaming, processing, storage, and serving. This architecture simplicity is an innovation over the Lambda or Kappa architectures historically needed. It gives what some call a **“Zero ETL”** solution for certain workflows (i.e., no need to ETL data between systems, since ingest and query are one system). The site had the slogan *“Next-Level Experience for Event Stream Processing”* and described how RisingWave blends stream processors and OLAP databases – implying it's unique in covering the full matrix of capabilities (continuous ingestion, transformation, serving *and* persistence).

- **Democratizing Stream Processing:** Perhaps not a technical feature, but an important innovation is making stream processing accessible to **SQL developers** without big data expertise. Yingjun Wu explicitly said they want to *“democratize stream processing, to make it simple, affordable, accessible”*. Achieving that through Postgres compatibility and fully managed state is a philosophical innovation. This could do to streaming what, say, MySQL did to relational DBs – make it ubiquitous for smaller teams who can’t invest in specialized knowledge. It matters because if successful, more companies can adopt real-time analytics who previously found streaming too complex.

- **Academic Foundations to Pragmatic Implementation:** RisingWave builds on research (some team members likely with database backgrounds) but also on practical experience from AWS Redshift, etc. It's unique in how it balances the two. For instance, Materialize took a very academic core (Timely Dataflow); RisingWave took a more pragmatic route (some would say simpler, but effective) – basically building a new execution engine rather than depending on an existing dataflow library, and focusing on cloud integration.

- **Use of WASM for UDFs:** The ability to run UDFs as WebAssembly in the engine is relatively forward-looking (ensures sandboxing, multi-language support, maybe even deploy functions from a UI). That isn't widespread in databases yet (though some, like Cloudflare D1 or some emerging systems use WASM). It points to a future where you can run complex code safely within the streaming SQL.

- **Integration with Data Lakes (Iceberg sink):** Not unique by itself, but RisingWave’s emphasis on streaming to lakehouses (they even have a product name “Streaming Lakehouse”) is notable. They see themselves playing a role in modern data stack by bridging streaming and the data lake world (Iceberg, Hudi, etc.). So they made it easy to sink to Iceberg, including hidden partitioning and all. That synergy of streaming DB + data lake is forward-thinking – enabling use cases like **real-time lakehouse updates**, something few others do out-of-the-box.

- **Community and Open Source Approach:** Compared to some competitors, RisingWave being true open source (Apache 2.0) is somewhat unique in this space (Materialize is BSL, others like Rockset or Delta Live Tables are closed). This open approach can accelerate innovation by community contributions and also differentiate it as a neutral platform not locking into a vendor ecosystem (like how ksqlDB locks you into Kafka).

**Why It Matters in the Broader Ecosystem:** RisingWave addresses a real gap in the data ecosystem: the need for **instant, continuous analytics** in a simplified stack. As data becomes more real-time (due to user expectations, IoT, etc.), systems like RisingWave are crucial to ingest and react to data with minimal delay and complexity. If it lives up to claims, organizations no longer need to maintain separate streaming jobs and analytics databases and can reduce data movement. This leads to more **timely insights** (business decisions can be made on live data rather than yesterday’s data) and potentially *new applications* that weren’t feasible before (like on-the-fly personalization for each user based on both live and historical data combined, or proactive device control in IoT factories from streaming analysis).

RisingWave’s presence also indicates the **convergence of databases and streaming** – traditional databases are adopting streaming features and streaming engines adopting database features. RisingWave is at that convergence point. This can inspire existing databases to incorporate more streaming (e.g., Snowflake’s dynamic tables, etc., which they mention), and push streaming frameworks to improve usability.

One concrete unique breakthrough is how RisingWave handles **streaming joins over large windows** reliably and can recover in seconds – historically, large window joins were a pain (could OOM or slow recovery). RisingWave’s architecture elegantly handles that by offloading state to storage.

In summary, RisingWave is unique for **combining the best of streaming and database worlds**: the **continuous, incremental processing of streaming** with the **familiar interface and robustness of databases**. Its **innovations** – decoupled architecture, SQL-first design, time travel, auto-scaling, etc. – are pushing the boundaries of what users expect from real-time data platforms. As the data ecosystem evolves, RisingWave stands out as a system that could significantly **simplify real-time data infrastructure** while **scaling to modern demands**, effectively making real-time analytics far more **accessible, cost-effective, and powerful** than before.
